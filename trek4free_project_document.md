## Executive Summary

**Trek4Free** is a grassroots outdoor resource platform designed to provide free, intuitive access to hiking trails, camping locations, and outdoor destinations across the United States. Born from the legacy of OutsideMyWay.com (2015-2018), this revival project leverages modern AI tools and open-source technologies to create a sustainable, ad-free platform that prioritizes user autonomy and data transparency.

**Key Differentiators:**
- Zero-cost core access with all essential features free forever
- No display advertising or user tracking - optional support mechanisms only
- Offline-first design with downloadable PDF maps
- Unified federal and state datasets with user contributions
- Focus on dispersed camping and free recreation opportunities
- Privacy-respecting, minimalist interface

**Current Status:** Static website prototype deployed on Netlify with basic mapping functionality and foundational data structures in place.

### Founders: Charlie and Amy
Outdoor enthusiasts with extensive experience in 4x4 van camping, trail running, rock climbing, and kayaking. Operators of a 1989 Toyota Van ("Billy Goat") used for off-grid adventures across diverse terrain. Their frustration with finding adventure-accessible camping spots and reliable offline maps in remote areas drives the project's practical focus.

,Free Camping,Lindsay Mtn Trailhead near Bell Mtn Wilderness.,37.62835,-90.83071,,,user
,Free Camping,"You can camp at the trailheads(there are three) and in the over 12,000 acres of Hercules Glades.  You can only access the wilderness area itself by horse or foot, but the camping at the trailhead is fine and FREE. Two of the trailheads(at the lookout tower and coy bald) have picnic tables and fire rings, one(Blair Ridge Road) is just a place to park(3 maybe 4 vehicles)but around it there is PLENTY of room to set up and camp.  I would NOT try to get an RV to coy bald, but the lookout tower trailhead is used by horse trailers and is a short gravel road off Hwy 125.    

Hercules Glades Wilderness Area is 12,413 acres of the most scenic and unique country in the Midwest. Its combination of open grassland, forested knobs, steep rocky hillsides, and narrow drainages offers unusual beauty and a measure of solitude within easy reach of wilderness lovers. The area is characterized by shallow droughty soils and limestone rock outcroppings. Eastern red cedar and oak trees are interspersed with open glades supporting native tall prairie grasses. Redbud and dogwood provide beautiful spring flowers, while smoke tree and maple put on vivid fall colors. A variety of wildlife species live within the Hercules Glades including white-tailed deer, raccoons rabbits, squirrels, turkey, quail, songbirds, lizards and snakes. Copperheads and rattlesnakes may be encountered. Roadrunners, collared lizards, tarantulas, wild hogs and black bears are some of the more uncommon wildlife residents.
 
Trails: From the trailheads there is 32 miles of maintained trails which follows along open glades, forested ridgetops and Long Creek, the primary drainage of the area. Cross country hiking in other parts of the area is allowed. Key attractions along the trail include Long Creek Falls, panoramic views of the Ozarks countryside, and a variety of native communities including open limestone glades and mixed forests.
Rating: More Difficult to Most Difficult with steep terrain, stream crossings, sparsely marked trail, and elevations from 600 to 1200 feet.
Length: 32 miles
Best Seasons: Fall, winter, and spring.
Leave No Trace: Pack out what you pack in.
Restrictions: Foot and Horse only.
 No drinking water is available at parking areas or along the trail; bring what you will need, or be prepared to sterilize water you find.

,Free Camping,"Hidden Valley RV Park is a pay RV Park with a few sites on the parks edge for free, one night stays for RV's only, no tents.  There are no facilities included so you must be self contained. Quiet and secure location. Must call in advance and arrive before 6pm in most cases. Sites not available after heavy rains since they are in a field. Only 15 minutes to downtown San Antonio. Access on a very decent gravel road (Campground Road)

    "description": "Just 40 minutes east of the hubbub of Bend, Oregon, sleepy Highway 27 winds 43 miles north from Highway 20 to the city of Prineville. Although the entire route is a state highway, the southernmost 18 miles are unpaved but are of high-standard graded gravel suitable for a passenger vehicle. Private ranches are interspersed among public rangelands with views of rolling hills and towering basaltic buttes. After the paved section begins, the back country byway crosses the spillway of Bowman Dam before descending into the gorge of the Chimney Rock segment of the Crooked Wild and Scenic River with its dozen recreation sites. Here, access to camping, fishing and hiking opportunities are available year-round.\n \n\nKnow Before You Go:\n\n\nNine year-round campgrounds, two day-use areas and a hiking trail line the wild and scenic river stretch of this byway.

Spring, Summer and Fall bring opportunities for hiking, trail-running and mountain biking the nearly 13 miles of unpaved trails. Skiers and other winter lovers can enjoy the gentle grade of the 2.9-mile Cowiche Canyon Trail, a former rail bed with eleven bridge crossings of Cowiche Creek. The Bureau of Land Management has partnered with the non-profit Cowiche Canyon Conservancy to provide access to this undeveloped natural landscape overlooking the city of Yakima.\nThe Cowiche Canyon is characterized by towering walls consisting of two types of lava, 17.5 million-year-old Columbia River flood basalts and one million-year-old andesite, the latter originating at Goat Rocks volcano, some 35 air miles away. The uplands above the canyon offer wide open spaces and spectacular views of Yakima, Mt. Adams, and an amazing springtime wildflower display covering the fragile lithosol soil.\n\nSummertime brings big contrasts to the Cowiche Canyon trail system. Upland plants of this shrub-steppe habitat like Desert Parsley, a biscuitroot, become dormant during drought months. In the neighboring Cowiche Creek riparian habitat, life abounds with more than 185 species of trees, shrubs and flowers and 125 bird species. Because of the area’s botanical richness, much of it is managed as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), a designation which provides a special emphasis on protecting this beautiful landscape.\nKnow Before You Go:\n \nThe Cowiche Canyon trail system is open for day-use only. Four small trailheads provide access to the area and almost 13 miles of unpaved trails. Trailer parking is available at the Cowiche Canyon railroad grade trailheads only; no trailer parking at the Summitview or Scenic Trailheads. \nPoison Ivy is abundant in the riparian area along the creek; protect yourself and your pet when on the trail.\n\nThe use of motorized vehicles, campfires, camping and firearm discharge is prohibited on Cowiche Canyon trail system lands.\n\nDogs must be under control at all times on these busy trails. Please pick up after your pet!\n\n\nPoint of Interest:\nThe Cowiche Canyon Trail was once the bed of the Burlington Northern Railroad, built in 1913, to haul apples from Cowiche and Tieton to fruit warehouses in Yakima. A few years before construction started, the area was described as a \"…very rocky canyon ... which is absolutely worthless for any use whatever except for railroad purposes.” The railroad abandoned the line in 1984 and the Cowiche Canyon Conservancy was formed the following year to obtain the right of way and develop a trail for public use.

Many of these trees are twenty feet in circumference, 200 feet tall, and 400 to 450 years old. Though a windstorm blew it down in 1981, the largest reached a circumference of thirty-five feet and was approximately 600 years old. Believed to be the second-largest Douglas fir in Oregon, the tree was called “Big Guy”.\n\nIn the 1970s, public concern grew over the increasing rarity of exceptionally large trees. In 1976, the BLM protected the 51-acres known as the Valley of the Giants by designating it an Outstanding Natural Area and an Area of Critical Environmental Concern. To this day, it is still used heavily by researchers and educators. In 2016, the BLM expanded the ACEC to over 1,600 acres in acknowledgment of the entire valley's ecological importance.\n\nThe Valley of the Giants contains all the features of an old-growth forest—large standing and fallen trees, logs and stumps, understory plants, fungi, and mosses. This spectacular topography can be seen right alongside the trail.\n\nThe forest preserve is located approximately 30 miles west of Falls City by way of logging roads not suitable for passenger cars. During fire season, public access is closed by a private gate near the beginning of the route.\n\nKnow Before You Go:\n\n\n\tVisitors should call the BLM’s Northwest Oregon District Office for directions and road closure information.\n\tFrom the trailhead to the Siletz River, the Valley of the Giants Trail is fairly steep and can be slippery when wet. The bridge across the north fork of the river, and the several steps leading up to it, can also be treacherous when wet or icy. The trail is approximately 1.3 miles long, and many of the huge trees surrounding it are on their last roots. Hikers should watch out for falling limbs and trees and avoid the area during high winds. Visitors are warned to hike these trails at their own risk.\n\tPrivate lands surround many Valley of the Giants access points and can only be crossed with permission from the landowner. Roads with closed gates are closed to the public. Please do not trespass on private land.\n\tAlthough the Valley of the Giants is only fourteen air miles from Falls City, rough narrow, and winding roads make it a slow, 30-mile trip. Visitors should allow at least 90 minutes of travel in each direction. Visitors are encouraged to contact the Northwest Oregon District before heading out to the site.\n\tPlease report any vandalism, trash dumping, or other crimes or accidents to the BLM’s Northwest Oregon District Office or the BLM’s law enforcement reporting number (800) 637-9152. This number is answered 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n\n\nPoint of Interest:\n\nThe Valley of the Giants is often used for research and education on old-growth forests. It is therefore important to stay on the trail to avoid impacting the soil, small animals, and plants. The picnic table area is the only point at which visitors are permitted to leave the designated trails.",

Annual precipitation occurs primarily as winter rain with some snow occurring most years at the highest elevations on San Benito Mountain.\n\n\n\nRecreational opportunities include hunting, camping, hobby gem/mineral collecting, mountain biking, horseback riding, hiking/backpacking, and sightseeing. Hobby gem and mineral collectors are drawn to the Clear Creek area, one of the most highly mineralized areas in California, by the presence of over 150 semi-precious minerals and gemstones. Among these are serpentine, jadeite, cinnabar, tremolite, topazite, neptunite, and the extremely rare California state gem, benitoite.\n\nThere are two developed campgrounds in the CCMA, Oak Flat and Jade Mill, both with picnic tables, shade structures, fire rings, and pit toilets.\n\nYou will find great views of the Central Valley and the Sierras in some areas, and you'll find yourself deep in the forest at others. Many places show evidence of past human activity, while others are so remote you might wonder if you are the first to travel there. Please be aware that there are many parcels of private land interspersed with the public land. Tread lightly and be courteous of the interests of others.\n\n \n\nVisiting Clear Creek Management Area\n\nPermits are required when visiting the CCMA. Please note that you may need multiple permits to access areas within the CCMA. Carefully read each permit description and use this chart to help you decide which permit(s) you may need. The following permits are available for advanced reservation:\n\nSerpentine Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) Permit: This free permit allows an individual to access the Serpentine ACEC within the Clear Creek Management Area for the duration of one day. Each person, regardless of age, entering the Serpentine ACEC is required to have a permit in their name and on their person. An individual is allowed a total of five permits per calendar year.\n\nClear Creek Vehicle Permit: Vehicles entering the Clear Creek Management Area, including the Condon Peak campground and trailhead, are required to have a Clear Creek Vehicle Permit. The permit is $5 per vehicle and allows the vehicle to enter the Clear Creek Management Area for seven days from the date of entry. Each vehicle must display the permit on its dash while in the Clear Creek Management Area.\n\nCondon Peak All-Terrain Vehicle (ATV) Permit: Every ATV or Utility Terrain Vehicle (UTV) entering Condon Peak’s trail network is required to have a permit. The permit cost is $10 and allows the ATV/UTV driver, age 16 and older, access to the route network at Condon Peak for seven days from the entry date.",

A series of user-created trails begin from this location. The most direct trailhead-to-ridgetop trail steeply climbs 1,000 feet over ~4/5 mile to reach the ridgetop.\n\nSome visitors prefer to follow McBee Road an additional 2 miles past the main trailhead to the ridgetop. There you can park, and hike or bike either east or west along the ridgetop trail. On windy days and/or when viewing/photographing nature, hikers sometimes alternatively side hill on either the north slope or south slope, traveling via both trail and/or cross country.\n\nHorseback riding is available, but with room for only approximately eight vehicles at the trailhead, very limited trailer parking is available.\n\n\nWhen recreating on public lands, practice Leave-No-Trace Principles.\n\n\n\nPoint of Interest:\nScenic views abound from high on the ridgetop, depending on weather/visibility. On a clear day, from Chandler Butte you can see: \nTo the west - Mt. Rainier and Mt. Adams. To the north - Yakima River Valley and its numerous vineyards, Benton City, and the Rattlesnake Mountains. To the NE — Red Mountain, Hanford, and the White Bluffs. To the east - Webber Canyon and its many orchards, and Badger Mountain.

    "description": "Nestled in Southern Oregon’s Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument, the Buck Prairie Nordic Trail System offers 32.8 miles of connected trails for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling. Snow tubers and sledders will find additional adventures in gravity at the sled hill located in the Table Mountain Winter Play Area. \n\nOn clear days, winter enthusiasts can enjoy views of the Rogue Valley and Siskiyou Mountains to the west, the Cascade Mountains to the east, Mt. McLaughlin to the north, and Mt. Shasta to the south.\n\nThe marked trail system includes directional signs with trail names, lengths and difficulty ratings. Some ski trails are groomed by the Bureau of Land\nManagement’s non-profit private partner, the Southern Oregon Nordic Club (SONC), whose volunteers provide hundreds of trail maintenance hours per year.\n\nMany other trails connecting the Buck Prairie Nordic Trail System to Hyatt Lake and Camper’s Cove are shared use trails (motorized and non-motorized use). The Buck Divide Trail connects with the Hyatt trail to connect Hyatt Lake Campground to the Buck Prairie Nordic trail system. Following the Dam Trail from the Hyatt Lake campground can also connect you with Camper’s Cove and eventually the Buck Prairie Ski trail system.\n\nSki Trails\nNatasha's Web: Easy/Moderate\nBeginning at the Buck Prairie Sno-Park, the first mile of Natasha’s Web provides access to all ski trails and is excellent for learning. When the road splits, near the restroom, stay to the right and follow the road uphill. You\ncan access additional trails or continue to follow Natasha’s Web through a large meadow eventually returning skiers to the Buck Prairie Trailhead on the lower road. Beginners may want to continue straight when the road\nsplits near the restroom and then return the same way.\n\n Bullwinkle's Run: Easy\nNatasha’s Web trail enters a meadow at the end of the upper road. Bullwinkle’s Run cuts across an opening to the right and enters the forest. This short trail ends at a scenic overlook with views of the Rogue Valley.\n\n\nRocky's Flight: Moderate \nLeave Natasha’s Web trail and continue past the junction with Bullwinkle’s Run. This short trail ends in a large meadow. At the lower end of the meadow, skiers may either continue on the Table Mountain Loop or return on Natasha’s Web.\n\n\nPeabody's Wayback: Difficult \nPeabody’s Wayback offers experienced skiers an alternative return to the Buck Prairie Trailhead. The trail begins just before the end of Bullwinkle’s Run. This steep trail makes several sharp switchbacks through trees and is not suitable for beginners.\n\n\n Fawn Hollow Loop: Moderate/Difficult\nFrom Buck Prairie Trailhead follow Natasha’s Web to where the road splits near the restroom, just past the restroom take a left. This trail is steep in a few sections.\n\n\n Table Mountain: Difficult\nFrom Buck Prairie Trailhead, in combination with Natasha’s Web, the Table Mtn. trail provides experienced skiers with a scenic 9.6 mile loop. The trail leaves Natasha’s Web in a meadow and enters the forest. At the trail’s high point, skiers enter a clearing with a view of Mt. Ashland. From this clearing, skiers descend a steep, narrow section of trail. Trail markers lead skiers to a shared use (both motorized and non-motorized) trail (Table Mountain Loop). Turn left and follow the road back to the trailhead.\n\n\nRyan's Trail: Easy \nA lost trail crew out working on the Table Mtn. Loop trail resulted in this trail. It is a short cut for those looking to take a little length off of their excursion on the Table Mtn. Loop or another opportunity for those looking for additional ski trails.\n\n\nDog Friendly Trails\nHomer's Hide Away: Moderate\nHomer’s Hide Away offers the ability to complete a loop trail with your best “animal” friend. The trail name memorializes a long time Park Ranger's best buddy. Like Homer himself who was known for his zeal for adventure, this trail passes along the edge of a forested area and stream plus an open meadow, assuring you of your own adventure. Access is from Buck Prairie 2 – Fido’s Trailhead.\n\nFido's Run: Moderate\nFido’s Run is a fun out and back with a short loop near the end of the trail. The trail is fairly flat except for a short downhill or uphill portion of the loop section, depending on which way you go on this loop section of the trail. Beginners may wish to stay to the left when the trail splits and tackle this loop portion of the trail going uphill.\n\nIce's Escape: Easy\nBeginning at the Buck Prairie – Fido’s Trailhead, Ice’s Escape is named after a legendary white German Sheppard that would “head for the hills” as soon as the car door was opened. Ice’s Escape allows skiers, snowshoers, and their dogs to “head for the hills” and access Fido’s Run and Homers Hide Away from the Buck Prairie 2– Fido’s Trailhead.\n\nTable Mountain Winter Play Trailhead\n\nFrom the Table Mountain Winter Play Area the Buck Prairie System is accessed by a shared use (open to both motorized and nonmotorized) trails originating in the sledding hill parking area. Look for a small kiosk in the southeastern portion of the parking area with a locator map showing where the trails are located.\n\n\nKnow Before You Go:\n \nBuck Prairie I and II Trailheads are non-motorized Sno-Parks and Hyatt Lake Campground Trailhead serves both motorized and non-motorized shared use trails.\n \nDogs are welcome on the 3 miles of canine-friendly trails at Buck Prairie II Trailhead- also known informally as “Fido’s Run Trailhead” as well as on shared use trails. Please keep your dog off the trails originating at Buck Prairie I Trailhead.\n\n\nPoint of Interest:\n Fans of the 1960s-era Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle animated television series might find humor -and adventure- on the show’s theme-named trails at Buck Prairie Nordic Trail System.",

The Natural Area is traversed by Cache Creek, with its year-round water flow. Elevation ranges from 3200 feet atop Brushy Sky High, down to 600 feet in the eastern end of Cache Creek along State Route 16. Showcasing the area is about 35 miles of the main fork of Cache Creek and 2.5 miles of the north fork.The Cache Creek Natural Area is a primitive area, closed to motorized vehicles. There are no developed campgrounds or facilities. Non-hunting (target) shooting is not allowed. Instead, the area is managed to improve habitat for wildlife and rare plants, to protect cultural resource values, and to offer primitive recreation opportunities, including wildlife viewing, river running, hiking, equestrian use, hunting and fishing. On October 17, 2006, President George W. Bush signed the Northern California Coastal Wild Heritage Act, designating approximately 27,245 acres within the Cache Creek Natural Area (CCNA) as the Cache Creek Wilderness Area. As a result of this designation, bicycles are not permitted within the designated Wilderness Area.

Most of the area includes the rugged Badlands volcano, which has features of inflated lava. Windblown volcanic ash and eroded lava make up the sandy, light-colored soil that covers the low and flat places in these fields of lava. Dry River, active during each of several ice ages, marks the southeast boundary between two volcanic areas—Badlands volcano and the Horse Ridge volcanoes. Earth movements along the Brothers Fault Zone have faulted and sliced up the old Horse Ridge volcanoes, but not Badlands volcano. The Badlands formed in an unusual way. The flow that supplied lava to the Badlands apparently developed a hole in the roof of its main lava tube. This hole became the source of lava that built a shield volcano that we call the Badlands (technically, a rootless shield volcano). An irregularly-shaped pit crater at the top of the shield marks the site where lava flowed in all directions to create the Badlands.\n\nA variety of wildlife species inhabit the area including yellow-bellied marmots, bobcat, mule deer, elk, and antelope. The southern portion of the Badlands Wilderness includes crucial winter range for mule deer. Avian species include prairie falcons and golden eagles.\n\nYou can also explore cracked volcanic pressure ridges, called tumuli, or walk narrow moat-like cracks in the ground. Traces of human history are visible to the careful observer. At 29,000 acres, the Oregon Badlands Wilderness represents an outstanding example of ancient western juniper woodlands atop Columbia River Basalts.

    "description": "The 34,400-acre Table Top Wilderness lies in western Pinal County. Table Top Mountain is the highest peak in the area and its flat-topped summit of 4,373 ft is a familiar landmark, easily recognized from Phoenix and Casa Grande. Steeply rising flat-top mesas, ridges, lava flows, wide canyons and mesquite-and ironwood-lined washes surround Table Top Peak.Hikers, backpackers, horseback riders and others venturing into the wilderness are rewarded with solitude. The four-mile-long Table Top Trail leads to the summit of Table Top, with the trailhead at the southwest corner of the wilderness (equestrian use not recommended on this trail due to steep conditions). The view from atop the peak provides a panorama of mountains ranges and desert plains. The abundant desert vegetation includes an unusual 40-acre island of desert grassland on the summit of Table Top and dense saguaro forests on the southwest side. The Lava Flow Trail meanders through the lowlands of the wilderness area. Desert bighorn sheep, coyote, quail, javelina, giant spotted whiptail lizard and the Ajo Mountain whipsnake, and numerous birds, reptiles and raptors abound.Know Before You GoMotorized equipment and equipment used for mechanical transport are generally prohibited on all federal lands designated as wilderness.

Due to its rich natural and cultural resources, part of Turkey Creek has been identified as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern by the Bureau of Land Management.The Turkey Creek cliff dwelling is one of the most intact structures of its kind in southeastern Arizona. It was probably occupied for a few months each year by prehistoric farmers around 1300 A.D. These people, of the Salado culture, probably collected plants along Turkey Creek, grew corn, and hunted wild animals. Salado farmers disappeared suddenly around 1450 A.D.Access to Turkey Creek is via a dirt road that is maintained by Graham County. Conditions vary with seasonal precipitation and may require high-clearance vehicles and sometimes four-wheel drive.Restrooms are located at a small parking area near the wilderness boundary; maps and information about the wilderness are available at the BLM ranger station in Klondyke.

King Peak, the highest point at 4,088 feet, is only 3-miles from the ocean. King Range is the Nation's very first National Conservation Area, designated in 1970.\n\nThe King Range encompasses 68,000 acres along 35-miles of California's dramatic north coast, where the landscape was too rugged for highway building, forcing State Highway 1 inland. Accessible by only a few back roads, this remote region of mountains and seascapes is also known as California's Lost Coast.\n\nThe King Range's Douglas fir-covered peaks attract hikers, hunters, and campers, while the coast beckons to surfers, anglers, beachcombers, and many others. World-class mountain bike trails, and 42,585 acres of coastal wilderness are two of the highlights of this incredibly unique area.\n\nThe King Range NCA contains over 80 miles of hiking trails spanning from the beach to the highest peaks. Most of the upland trails are strenuous due to the steep rugged nature of the area. In addition to mileage, pay attention to the elevation changes listed in the trail descriptions. A number of connector trails allow for loop hikes.\n\nThe backcountry was designated as official wilderness on October 17, 2006 and the BLM manages it accordingly, so expect no facilities and minimal signing on trails. Some of the lesser used trails (such as Rattlesnake Ridge, Spanish Ridge and Cooskie Creek) may be somewhat overgrown and difficult to follow. Its best to carry a map and compass with you, and call the BLM office before your trip to get the latest trail conditions.\n\nWinter Weather & Ocean Advisory: Winter storms & waves in the King Range NCA can make portions or all of the Lost Coast Trail dangerous and even impossible to traverse, regardless of tidal level. Additionally, heavy rains may cause downed trees or landslides along upland trails. Heavy rains may cause stream crossings to become hazardous and may impede travel. We at BLM recommend that you do not cross creeks that are above your knee. Be patient. Wait for water level to subside. Please contact the King Range Project Office at (707) 986-5400 or the Arcata Field Office at (707) 825-2300 for updates on current conditions and check The National Weather Service (http://www.weather.gov/eka/) for current coastal conditions.",

Please RECREATE RESPONSIBLY.\n\n\nOverview\n\nThe Snake River used to flow across the northern portion of the Snake River Plain, but now flows along the southern margin of the Plain. The river was pushed there by successive lava flows. Sixty six thousand acres are within a Wilderness Study Area (WSA). The northwest end of the lava flow has been designated as a National Natural Landmark by the US Park Service. Today, three trails go across this desolate landscape, one primitive and the other two developed with interpretive signs. Even though this area looks uninhabited, it is growing and alive with wildlife and vegetation.\n\nHawaiian Landscape in Idaho\n\nThe Lava Trails traverse the desert of the Snake River Plain through contorted landscapes created from multiple lava flows. These Hawaiian-type lava flows are associated with the stretching of the earth’s crust. Hell’s Half Acre lava flow erupted about 4,100 years ago and is 222 square miles or 162,000 acres. The lava flowed at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, had the consistency of molasses, and traveled at speeds up to 30 mph.\n\nGeology\n\nLava rock is extremely sharp, glassy and fragmented, with open cracks, lava tubes and caves. A'a (ah-ah) and pahoehoe (pa-hoy-hoy) lava flows are the most prevalent here. Areas of soil and vegetation not covered by lava are called kipuka, a Hawaiian word meaning 'window in the lava.'\n\nBotany\n\nIn the spring and early summer, numerous wildflowers, such as Evening Primrose, Indian Paintbrush, wild onions, penstemon, geraniums, and Prickly Pear Cactus, color the landscape. Bright, green ferns grow in deep cracks. Plants ranging in size from tiny mosses and lichens to juniper trees hundreds of years old grow here. Other native species include sagebrush, rabbitbrush, bitterbrush, blue bunch wheatgrass, and needle-andthread grass.\n\nWildlife\n\nWildlife roaming the lava flows include mule deer, antelope, rabbits, bobcats, coyotes, foxes, and rattlesnakes. Soaring above the flows are red-tailed hawks, prairie falcons, and golden eagles.\n\nThe Lava Trail system is open to non-motorized recreation activities only.",

The trail to the summit of the North Butte offers exceptional opportunities to explore the unique geology and natural history of this area. North Menan Butte is designated as a National Natural Landmark and a Research Natural Area. These designations help preserve the Butte so visitors can enjoy and study this unique geologic area in its natural condition. North Menan Butte is also a BLM Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC).\n\nThe Menan Buttes are extinct volcanoes formed by violent eruptions 10,000 years ago. These are unusual formations because they erupted through the cold waters of the Snake River which flowed where the Buttes stand today. When molten magma met the cold river water it cooled so quickly crystals were unable to form, and the lava solidified into glass called tachylite. The heat of the magma flashed the river water to steam, shattering the glass into tiny fragments that welded together as the hot ash settled to the ground. The Menan Buttes are unique because these are the only volcanic eruptions that occurred in freshwater in the United States, which is why North Menan Butte is designated a National Natural Landmark. \nFacilities: Vault toilet, interpretive signs \nLength: 3.1 mile trail from parking area to the top, around the rim and back down (0.6 miles cutting through the bowl of the butte) \nThere are no day-use fees associated with this site. \nKnow before you go: \nNorth Menan Butte is open to non-motorized recreation activities only.  Help protect important vegetation and prevent erosion by minimizing impact to the area. Motorized vehicles have traveled up the butte in the past, creating scars that can be seen from the parking area.

The mountain range is composed of jagged, high spires with steep rocky ridges interspersed by narrow rocky canyons. The steep, angular, rock pinnacles and outcroppings are massive. The northern area is granite, while the southern portion is rhyolite, which creates a distinct color variation. Vegetation consists of mixed desert shrubs, piñon, and juniper woodlands and, in narrow chasms between rock outcrops, ribbons of green oak trees and ponderosa pine. Many of the canyons contain seasonal or year-long springs which create unique habitats for plants and animals. Archaeological sites include remnants of historic mining and prehistoric rock shelters.",

Please RECREATE RESPONSIBLY.\n\n\nOverview\n\nEncompassing 154,000 acres, including just over 100,000 acres of already congressionally designated Wilderness, Sand to Snow National Monument is an ecological and cultural treasure and one of the most biodiverse areas in southern California, supporting more than 240 species of birds and twelve threatened and endangered wildlife species. Home to the region's tallest alpine mountain that rises from the floor of the Sonoran Desert, the monument also will protect sacred, archaeological and cultural sites, including an estimated 1,700 Native American petroglyphs. Featuring thirty miles of the world-famous Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, the area is a favorite for camping, hiking, hunting, horseback riding, photography, wildlife viewing, and even skiing.\n\nKnow Before You Go\n\nSacred Heritage\n\nThe Serrano and Cahuilla Indian people lived at the base of San Gorgonio Mountain and considered it a sacred place. The Mountain provided food, medicinal plants, basket making material, deer and other animals to hunt. San Gorgonio Pass served as a major trade route from Arizona to the California coast.\n\nRecreation\n\nThe 11,500-foot San Gorgonio Mountain rises sharply from the Sonoran Desert floor and is the highest peak in California south of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range. The Monument includes 30 miles of the 2,600-mile Pacific Crest Trail, and visitors can enjoy, hiking, camping, backpacking, climbing, horseback riding, hunting, fishing, stargazing, mountain biking, photography, wildlife viewing, cross country skiing, and solitude. A series of preserves owned by the Wildlands Conservancy are managed for public access and serve as entry points from the north, south, and east of the Monument.\n\nCamping\n\nCampfire permits are required and may be restricted during fire season. Fire danger is extreme for most of the year. Campfire permits can be obtained online at www.preventwildfireca.org.

    "name": "Birch Hollow",
    "description": "Birch Hollow is a side canyon of Orderville Canyon in the Orderville Canyon Wilderness Study Area. With its twisting passages and striking descents, Birch Hollow offers canyoneers a superlative day trip. The route requires technical canyoneering skills and equipment, with rappels of up to 120 feet (40 meters).Birch Hollow is undeveloped, with no designated trails or amenities. Most visitors begin at the Birch Hollow kiosk on North Fork Road. From the kiosk, an unmaintained path leads about a mile to the first rappel. Alternatively, a user-created bypass route can be used to avoid the first drop. The route continues downcanyon through a series of rappels before reaching the confluence with Orderville Canyon. From here, most visitors exit the canyon system by hiking upstream to the Orderville Canyon trailhead and shuttling back to the Birch Hollow kiosk. Alternative user-identified routes can eliminate the need for a shuttle, but they require good route-finding skills and are often difficult to follow. Some visitors opt to hike downcanyon in Orderville Canyon into Zion National Park, ultimately exiting the canyon system by way of the Virgin River Narrows. This route requires additional rappels and a Zion National Park canyoneering permit. It makes for an extremely long day hike that should not be underestimated.Birch Hollow is critical habitat for the threatened Mexican spotted owl and contains other important resources such as wilderness character. Limit group size to 12 people or fewer to minimize impacts to wildlife and other resources. If you have a larger group, break it up and allow at least a 30-minute buffer between groups.Please do your part to protect Orderville Canyon Wilderness Study Area by following Leave No Trace principles: Plan ahead and prepare to ensure that you have detailed route information as well as proper skills and equipment. Bring all supplies, including drinking water, with you. Be self-sufficient and don’t expect others to rescue you in an emergency.Dispose of waste properly and packing out what you pack in.Protect soils and vegetation by traveling on durable surfaces and staying low in the drainage as you hike.Leave what you find, and don’t mark rock faces or disturb vegetation. Adding bolts or chains or other climbing equipment is prohibited.Respect wildlife by maintaining your distance and not harassing or feeding wild animals.Be considerate of other visitors by keeping noise down and allowing faster groups to pass you in the canyon to avoid bottlenecks at obstacles.Know before you go: Slot canyons like Birch Hollow are flood prone and should not be attempted if there is a risk of rain or flash flooding.Attempting to access the trailheads for Birch Hollow and Orderville Canyon by passenger car is not recommended. The unpaved portion of North Fork Road is clay based and quickly becomes impassable to even 4-wheel-drive vehicles when wet.",

In this wilderness, an 8-by-10 mile block of Navajo Sandstone, bounded by 2,000-foot-high cliffs, has been sculpted by wind and water over time into a landscape of soaring cliff walls, natural arches, and slot canyons. On the highest plateaus, stands of ponderosa pine are surrounded by cream-colored slickrock. Pinyon pine, Utah juniper, scrub oak, and sagebrush cover the mountain slopes, at lower elevations.  Seeps in the canyon walls provide water for hanging gardens of maidenhair fern, monkeyflower, and columbine. Hawks, falcons, and golden eagles nest along the sandstone walls, while ringtailed cats, deer, cougar, and black bear live on the plateaus and in the canyon bottoms.This wilderness provides opportunities for primitive recreational activities, including hiking, equestrian trail riding, canyoneering, and camping. Several routes exist on the southern end of the wilderness providing access to higher elevations by way of steep canyons. The Sawmill trail, however, follows an historic logging route and traverses a large portion of the wilderness.

    "description": "During the Formative Period (ca. 700 B.C. to A.D. 1200) the indigenous people (labeled by archaeologists as Ancestral Puebloans or Virgin Anasazi) became corn and bean farmers who irrigated their crops by diverting water from streams like the Santa Clara River. They constructed permanent village sites and produced fine quality ceramics. Populations living along the Santa Clara River appear to have increased between A.D. 700-1100 (Pueblo I-II), leaving abundant and tangible evidence of their presence on Land Hill and river corridor.\n\nAfter A.D. 1200, archaeological sites attributable to the Ancestral Puebloans become increasingly rare, suggesting that changing climatic conditions or other factors forced a change in lifestyle for these early farmers. During the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric Periods (after approximately A.D.1200-1800), the only indigenous people who permanently occupied the region were the Southern Paiute. At springs and along the stream channels, they, too, practiced small-scale farming. Hunting and gathering of native plants were also important in the economic adaptations of the early Southern Paiute.\n\nThe Shivwits Band of Southern Paiute continue to make the banks of the Santa Clara their homeland. Permanent agricultural settlements were established by Mormon pioneers along the Santa Clara River during the mid-19th Century. These settlements often displaced the Southern Paiute who had traditionally cultivated the same lands along the river. The early Mormon settlers of southern Utah used the nearby canyons and hills in the area. Several geographic features still bear the names given to them by those early residents: “Big Rock,” “The Gate Rocks,” and Cove Wash.\n\nThe public is invited to visit the Santa Clara/Land Hill Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) commonly known as the Land Hill Heritage Site.&nbsp;Located in the west central portion of Washington County, the Land Hill Heritage Site is directly southwest of the communities of Ivins and Santa Clara and east of the Shivwits Indian Reservation.\n\nThe Land Hill Heritage Site is part of the Santa Clara River Reserve. The reserve protects open space, archaeological and natural resources, and recreational opportunities important to local communities. Contained within the reserve is the Santa Clara/Land Hill Area of Critical Environment Concern, which contains numerous prehistoric sites and vital riparian habitat.",

    "description": "Orson B. Adams House\n\nThe St. George Field Office has completed rehabilitation of a mid-19th century Mormon pioneer residence for adaptive re-use.  This small sandstone masonry house was built in 1863 for the Orson B. Adams family, in the now abandoned Mormon agricultural settlement of Harrisburg, located approximately 15 miles north of St. George.   Critical to the successful completion of the rehabilitation project were partnerships with Washington County, the Utah Heritage Foundation, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation; technical assistance from the Utah State Historic Preservation Office; and volunteer labor during several phases of the project.  The Adams house is open sporadically for public visitation with the assistance of volunteer docents.  \n\nIn 2004, Washington County, Utah State University (USU), and the Utah Chapter-American Society of Landscape Architects worked with BLM to create a conceptual plan for public recreation use of the 215 acres that surround the Adams house.  Quail Creek flows through the tract, creating a lush riparian area with tall cottonwood trees and willows. Other historic Harrisburg structures, terraced gardens, an orchard, fields outlined by native rock walls, irrigation ditches, and wagon roads are preserved on the property.  Students and faculty from USU documented the features of this still-intact 19th century agrarian landscape, as part of the first Historic American Landscape Survey conducted in Utah.  The final concept plan will integrate the Adams house with a system of linked hiking, mountain biking, and equestrian trails that connect to trails in the Red Cliffs Recreation Area, the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, and the nearby historic Silver Reef mining district.\n\nBased on the conceptual plan, BLM completed an environmental assessment for the proposed development of a non-motorized trail system and an equestrian trailhead. Today the White Reef Trailhead provides access to a trail system that visits 5 public use sites within the Red Cliffs Recreation Area including the Orson B. Adams House.",

From the trailhead, the trail immediately drops down a steep, rugged slope and careens toward the cliff edge on your right.  Follow the narrow, winding track southeast as it traverses the crumbling layers of sandstone, siltstone and mudstone below the mesa rim. Expect a steep, rocky descent along the entire trail, with sharp turns, sudden drop-offs and precipitous exposure. Keep in mind that entire sections of the trail may be washed out in places due to its location on a steep, eroded slope. The trail becomes braided in several sections, allowing users to choose one of several interconnected paths on their descent.If you have time to look up, you’ll be rewarded with dramatic vistas of colorful badlands in the foreground, Gooseberry Mesa to the south, the craggy peaks of Canaan Mountain Wilderness to the southeast and the majestic West Temple of Zion National Park to the east.While keeping your eyes on the trail, you will experience a speedy ride-through tour of local geology. The trail begins in the Chinle Formation of the Upper Triassic Age atop the mesa then descends quickly through the Moenkopi layer of the Lower Triassic, a blur of red sandstone under your tires.  Soon after, you are plummeting through talus from the Holocene to upper Pleistocene Age before revisiting the Moenkopi Formation near the bottom of the escarpment.Once the trail drops to rolling lowlands and levels out, find your way back to SR 9 near Virgin by following the well-traveled dirt road south.   Note: This trail should only be considered by expert mountain bicyclists. Throughout its length, it features narrow tread width, widely variable and unpredictable tread surfaces, 20% or more average trail grade, jumps, unavoidable obstacles, loose rocks and extreme exposure. There are no convenient places to stop or turn around and the cost of a mistake in many places could result in serious injury or death. Use extreme caution, always wear a helmet, and ride at your own risk.",

The trail climbs the Vermilion Cliffs to an alcove filled with unique, approximately 870- to 1,070-year-old petroglyphs that have been pecked and carved into the alcove’s sloping, sandstone floor.From the trailhead, the Mansard Trail ascends approximately 950 feet over a series of switchbacks, offering increasingly sweeping views of Kanab and the plateaus of northern Arizona. As the trail reaches the top of the Vermilion Cliffs, it negotiates a short section of rough stone slabs, which may require a mild scramble. From here, the trail crosses the sandy plateau to arrive at the base of the White Cliffs, where a scenic alcove contains petroglyphs from the Pueblo II period (AD 950 to 1150).Native American groups identify images like these as “rock writing,” because they were a form of communication rather than decoration. Respect and protect rock writing and archaeological sites:Keep discovery alive. Archaeological sites are fragile and irreplaceable. Treat sites with the respect they deserve so that future generations can experience these direct links to the past.Don’t touch rock writing or make your own. Never touch, deface, trace, slide on, or otherwise damage rock writing. Direct contact with rock surfaces causes the images to deteriorate, permanently erasing them and destroying the experience for future visitors. Do not make your own markings or signatures on any of the rock surfaces around the site. Leave the sand where it is – don’t dig holes or brush off the rock writing panel. Vandalism, damage, defacement, or removal of any artifact or rock writing image on public lands is illegal and can result in fines or imprisonment.Watch your step. Do not step or climb on the rock surface in the alcove. Take care not to cause damage with hiking poles.Don’t camp, eat, or go to the bathroom near the site. Camping, fires, food, and human waste damage archaeological remains and spoil the view for other visitors.Teach kids respect. Archeological sites are not playgrounds. Please teach children to be respectful visitors and keep an eye out to prevent them from getting hurt or accidentally damaging sites.Keep dogs on leash. Pets should be leashed and kept away from the alcove to prevent damage, digging, or other impacts to the site. Please clean up and pack out pet waste.Report vandalism or damage. Help protect your public lands.

The trail was built for hikers, but is open to all forms of non-motorized use. The Pinnell Mountain Trail is marked with rock cairns as it crosses open tundra with views north to the Yukon River and south to the Alaska Range. Wooden posts along the trail show the mileage from the start at Eagle Summit to the trail's end at Twelvemile Summit. Two  shelters provide refuge from storms, but hikers should come prepared for unpredictable, dramatic alpine weather.  Finding drinking water along the trail can become difficult later in the summer, when snowfields and small ponds dry up. Water is generally available at both shelter cabins, where catchment systems collect melting snow and rain. An accessible interpretive loop trail leads to an observation deck near the Eagle Summit Trailhead.",

From the lush riparian areas surrounding the Sacramento River and it's tributaries to the expanse of the rolling hills of blue oak savannah, the Sacramento River Bend Area offers diverse habitat for bald eagles, osprey, migratory and song birds, deer, and salmon. The area also offers numerous recreation opportunities for hunting, camping, hiking, boating, picnicking, and wildlife viewing.\n\nTrails\n\nMost attractions along the river can be reached by foot, mountain bike or horseback.\n\nWildflowers\n\nThis area offers amazing wildflowers viewing in the spring. The rolling hills of this oak woodland are carpeted with purple and yellow in all directions.\n\nBoating Access\n\nThe Sacramento River (from Balls Ferry to Red Bluff) is served by a variety of developed boat ramps and primitive river access sites. Public boat ramps are available at Balls Ferry, Bend Bridge Park, and Lake Red Bluff Recreation Area. Jelly's Ferry, Barge Hole, and Perry Riffle (walk in only) offer primitive launch sites. The boat ramp at Reading Island can be used by small watercraft, but is usually overgrown with vegetation during the summer months making it challenging for any watercraft. Please see the Sacramento River Bend Area map for specific locations and directions.\n\nPaynes Creek Wetlands\n\nConcerns have increased in recent years over population declines of migratory bird species that breed in North America and winter south of the United States - Neotropical Migratory Birds. The BLM recognizes this problem and has created the Payne's Creek Wetlands with the help of partners like California Fish and Game, Bureau of Reclamation, California Wildlife Conservation Board, and Ducks Unlimited in an effort to enhance populations of these birds and other species. The BLM manages this wetland area, located along the Pacific Flyway, to protect and enhance the existing riparian habitat and wildlife communities, as well as provide for recreational use, cultural and natural interpretation, and educational opportunities.\n\nDownload the Birds of Bend Brochure to discover all the birds that frequent the area.\n\nCamping\n\nAlthough there are no developed BLM campgrounds in this area, camping is allowed on most BLM lands for up to 14 days per calendar year. Day-use sites such as the Jelly's Ferry site, the mouth of Inks Creek, and the Bass Pond parking areas are closed to camping. Group camping is available at the Reading Island Group Campground, under a special use permit issued by the BLM. Massacre Flat is a popular primitive campsite for boaters. The state managed Battle Creek and Cottonwood Creek Wildlife Areas are closed to camping. There is no garbage collection in most of the area so if you PACK IT IN please PACK IT OUT.\n\nHunting\n\nMost BLM lands are open to hunting under California Department of Fish and Game regulations. Some sites such as Reading Island and the state managed Battle Creek Wildlife Area are closed to hunting and shooting. Be courteous to private property owners adjacent to public land. Remember, it is against State law to discharge a weapon within 150 yards of a dwelling or outbuilding. Target shooting is prohibited with the exception of one designated target shooting area along Spring Branch Road. Please remove all shells and debris to keep your public lands clean and safe.\n\nSafety Concerns\n\n• The Sacramento River water is cold (45°-50°) year-round and is deceptively swift and powerful.\n\n• Always wear an approved floatation device when on the river.\n\n• The Yana Trail fords Inks Creek and is impassible at times of wet weather. Contact the BLM Redding Field Office prior to a wet weather hike on the Yana Trail.\n\n• Rattlesnakes are a common sight on warm days. Watch your step.\n\n• Summer temperatures in this area can exceed 100°F and there is no potable water available in the area, so bring plenty of drinking water.",

Most sections of trail offer gentle grades and are suitable for all age groups. There are several side trails that lead to vistas or access the reservoirs edge and seasonal cascades.\n\nThe Hornbeck Trail was the first trail segment in this network to be built and follows the path of a historic mining railroad on the east side of the river. It is named for a volunteer who was instrumental in its development.  Volunteers unofficially named the trail segment for volunteer Chuck Hornbeck, a retired civil engineer and Shasta College engineering instructor, who was a leader in determining the trail route and recording important historic information.  The trail segment follows the path of a historic mining railroad called the “Old Diggings Railroad,” the “Quartz Hill Railroad,” or the “Mammoth Mine Railroad.\"  The rail line was used in the early 1900s to haul quartz used as flux for nearby copper smelting at Kennett (now under Shasta Lake). \n\nThe Upper Sacramento and Lower Sacramento Ditch trails follow the alignment of the historic Sacramento water ditch.

Along the way, visitors are treated to a variety of Sonoran Desert plants and wildlife, scenic vistas, and evidence of the area's volcanic history. The view from atop the summit is a dramatic panorama of rugged mountain ranges and desert plains.The trail begins by crossing several small washes and bajadas (desert outwash plains), and winds northeasterly toward Table Top Mountain through forests of saguaro, cholla, prickly pear, paloverde, and ironwood. At the base of the mountain, the trail begins a series of switchbacks on its steep ascent to the summit. Near the summit the trail is bordered by four-foot- tall walls of loosely piled stones, the origin and purpose for which are unknown. Vegetation on the summit includes an unusual, 40-acre island of desert grassland.FacilitiesTable Top Trailhead includes a small, three-site campground with picnic tables, fire-rings, a vault toilet, and day use parking for approximately 10 vehicles.

The area is generally rugged terrain of the southern Bighorn Mountains dominated by pine, scattered mountain mahogany, and meadows. Beartrap Creek and the North Fork of the Red Fork of the Powder River flow through the area in deep, steep-walled canyons.  Part of the Dull Knife Battlefield, a National Historic Site, extends into the southern part of the area.  The Gardner Mountain WSA offers outstanding opportunities for primitive and unconfined recreation in the forms of hiking, fishing, hunting, and sightseeing. The steep canyon walls, limited number of access points and steep mountainous terrain are natural barriers that affect human movement within the WSA and enhance the primitive character.  There is no direct public access to the Gardner Mountain WSA. Access is predominately controlled by adjacent private landowners and landowner permission is required to cross any private lands. However, the area may be legally accessed via the Gardner Mountain Trail  in combination with cross-country travel through steep topography.  The Gardner Mountain Foot and Horse Trail is open to hikers and horseback riders. It ambles through a mountain meadow and then follows a ridgeline overlooking the Gardner Mountain WSA.  Please respect private property boundary signs and practice Leave No Trace!  A land status map and compass or GPS unit are strongly recommended.",

    "name": "San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge",
    "description": "The San Joaquin River National Wildlife Refuge located in Stanislaus County encompasses more than 7,300 acres of riparian woodlands, wetlands, and grasslands that host a diversity of wildlife native to California’s Great Central Valley. The refuge is situated where three major Valley rivers – San Joaquin, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus – join creating a mosaic of habitats that provide ideal conditions for great wildlife and plant diversity. The refuge was established in 1987 under the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Conservation Act. The refuge has played a major role in the recovery of Aleutian cackling geese by serving as an important wintering area and continues to be of major importance to this species. By the mid-1970s, the total population of Aleutian cackling geese was fewer than 1,000. Removing nest predators from the breeding grounds in Alaska’s Aleutian Islands and improving wintering habitat in California’s Great Central Valley resulted in the goose being delisted as an endangered species and a population today well over 200,000 and growing. Restoring wetlands, and providing grasslands and croplands at this refuge has provided ideal wintering habitat for the geese.   It is estimated that ninety-five percent of the San Joaquin Valley’s riparian woodlands were lost during the last century due to changing land uses. This critical habitat is being restored on a landscape level at the refuge.  Within the borders of the refuge is one of California’s largest riparian woodland restoration projects to date:  more than ½ million native trees and shrubs including willows, cottonwoods, oaks, blackberry, and rose have been planted across 2,500 acres of river floodplain, creating the largest block of contiguous riparian woodland in the San Joaquin Valley. This important riparian woodland habitat supports many rare animals.Through efforts at the refuge, there is hope the highly-endangered riparian brush rabbit will one day join the Aleutian cackling goose as a fully-recovered species. Riparian brush rabbits are endemic to the riparian woodlands of California’s Great Central Valley. By the 1990s, their numbers dwindled to near extinction because of habitat loss and degradation. The last known population was discovered along the Stanislaus River in San Joaquin County. Through a partnership with the Endangered Species Recovery Program at California State University, Stanislaus, captive-bred rabbits have been released into the refuge’s well-suited dense riparian woodlands. By establishing a new large population of rabbits, these efforts will help foster successful recovery for this endangered mammal. The refuge contains the largest population of riparian brush rabbits in the world.  The riparian woodlands on the refuge support a diversity of bird species. Swainson’s hawks nest in the canopy of tall cottonwood trees. Herons, egrets, and cormorants form communal nesting colonies within the tops of the large valley oaks. Breeding songbirds including grosbeaks, orioles, flycatchers, and warblers nest in woodlands on the refuge.  The refuge features the 4-mile Pelican nature trail (open year-round) that meanders through seasonal wetlands, restored riparian woodlands, and stands of old-growth valley oak trees. The trailhead includes a 7-acre native vegetation free-roam exploration area. The Beckwith wildlife observation area (open seasonally) is a favorite location for viewing the Aleutian cackling geese and sandhill cranes along with other waterbirds.Every national wildlife refuge was created for a specific purpose. Some were created to protect migratory birds, others to protect threatened or endangered species, or unique habitats, while others fulfill another specific purpose. All activities allowed on refuges must be evaluated to make sure no activity conflicts with the reason the refuge was founded.The San Joaquin River NWR was established in 1987 under the authorization of the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Conservation Act to provide wintering habitat for endangered Aleutian cackling geese.",

Follow bear and mountain lion country precautions as these animals are becoming more common along Bonita Creek. The creek's clear, cool water is inviting for a soak, but must be treated before drinking due to human, cattle, and wildlife activity upstream. Carry plenty of drinking water with you. Few people travel this remote route, and it remains difficult to follow because it crosses land of mixed ownership. You will need topo maps and a compass to hike this moderate to difficult trail. The best time to hike is fall through the spring months because there is little water and shade.

The primary purpose for the designation is to protect and enhance the desert riparian ecosystem, a rare remnant of what was once an extensive network of similar riparian systems throughout the Southwest.Many recreational opportunities are available within the NCA. Three of the most popular sites are:Murray Springs Clovis Site, a significant archaeological site that contains an undisturbed stratigraphic record of the past 40,000 years. Excavations were conducted by the University of Arizona from 1966 to 1971. People first arrived in this area 11,000 years ago. They belonged to what we now call the Clovis Culture and were the earliest known people to have inhabited North America. Named after the distinctive and beautifully crafted Clovis spear points they made, they were expert hunters of the large mammals of the last Ice Age. An interpretive trail leads visitors through the site. From Sierra Vista, take Arizona Route 90 east six miles to Moson Road. Turn left and go about 1.2 miles to the signed turnoff to Murray Springs. Park your vehicle and proceed by foot down the access road to the trail leading to the Murray Springs Clovis Site. The access road leading to the Murray Springs trail is currently closed to vehicle traffic.The Spanish Presidio Santa Cruz de Terrenate is the most intact remaining example of a once-extensive network of similar presidios. These fortresses marked the northern extension of New Spain into the New World. Only a stone foundation and a few remaining adobe wall remnants mark the location of an isolated and dangerous military station. From Fairbank on Arizona Route 82, drive approximately 2 miles west on Route 82, turn right on the Kellar Ranch Road and travel approximately 3 miles to the trailhead. Hike about 2 miles to the ruins and interpretive displays.The San Pedro House, located 9 miles east of Sierra Vista on Arizona Route 90, is a popular trailhead for birdwatchers, hikers, and mountain bikers.

In the lower elevations is a chaparral plant community consisting of Sonoran scrub oak, manzanita, desert ceanothus, silktassel, and scattered pinon pine. The trail travels along Moss Wash underneath the tall pines or within a riparian area of Arizona black walnut and species of willows. The trail passes several areas of historic mining activities, including Gold King Mansion.The trailheads are 4,420 and 6,080 feet in elevation and the trail has a peak elevation of 6,485 feet. Recommended vehicles are four-wheel drives, all-terrain vehicles (ATVs), universal terrain vehicles (UTVs) and motorcycles. Due to the condition of the southeast part of the trail within a mile of Gold King Mansion, motor vehicles are limited to non-stock four-wheel drives, four-wheel drives with short wheelbase, ATVs, and UTVs.Weather conditions are most comfortable in the spring, summer (mornings), and fall seasons.

    "name": "Juniper Dunes Wilderness",
    "description": "The US Congress designated the Juniper Dunes Wilderness in 1984 and it now has over 7,140 acres. The Juniper Dunes Wilderness preserves the northernmost growth of western juniper, some of which have been around for 150 years, along with windswept sand dunes measuring 130 feet in height and 1200 feet in width. Other than junipers, no trees grow in significant numbers here, but many bushes and flowers bloom wondrously come spring, although the mountains that separate western and eastern Washington generally wring the moisture from the air.\n\nThe landscape here takes quite a battering; in fact, with strong southwest winds to build the dunes, seven to eight inches of precipitation to moisten them, a foot or so of snow that drifts down in winter, and summer temperatures that occasionally rise above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Elevations range from 750 feet to 1,130 feet above sea level. But plenty of animals thrive despite the extremes: mule deer, bobcats, coyotes, badgers, skunks, weasels, porcupines, pocket gophers, kangaroo rats, several species of mice, hawks, owls, ravens, quail, partridge, pheasants, doves, numerous songbirds, and rattlesnakes.\n\nThe entire wilderness is surrounded by privately-owned lands. Getting all the way to the Wilderness gate can be risky business, even with a high clearance 4-wheel drive vehicle (highly recommended), and there is a significant risk of getting stuck in the loose sand of the last jeep trail, Wilderness Road, especially in warm months when there is little moisture in the sand. One option is to park at the Off-Highway Vehicle staging area on Juniper Road (also a jeep trail) and walk an additional +1 mile to the Wilderness Gate.\n\nYou'll find no maintained trails nor water in the Wilderness, and backpackers and horseback riders should be aware of the likelihood of large temperature variations during overnight stays.\n\nSince the early 1960s, Juniper Dunes has been a popular regional outdoor recreation area. Its current 19,600 acres is split into three adjoining area designations, each having its own use regulations: the Juniper Dunes Wilderness (designated by Congress in 1984), an Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC), and an OHV “Open” Area. Currently, more than 30,000 people visit Juniper Dunes annually, most of them coming for OHV recreation.\n\nKnow Before You Go:\n\n\n\tPublic access to Juniper Dunes Wilderness is very challenging. The main access point into the wilderness is via the Wilderness Gate. Only non-motorized/non-mechanized access is allowed into the wilderness.\n\tTo get to the Wilderness Gate, travel paved Juniper Dunes Road to its northern end where it connects to a very primitive OHV access road. Many people park/unload here and continue via hiking, horseback, or by OHV suited to dunes travel. For motorized road travel beyond the end of the paved road, at minimum a high clearance 4-wheel-drive is highly recommended. Travel north 1.25 miles on the access road until you reach the OHV area upper parking/staging area, which is in loose sand. Without an OHV suited to dunes travel, the risk of getting a motorized vehicle stuck in the loose sand road conditions increases traveling any farther north from here. Another road mile further to the north is a signed intersection for Wilderness Road. Continue one more mile on Wilderness Road to the Wilderness Gate. Even high clearance 4-wheel-drive vehicles can easily get stuck on Wilderness Road, including under the best of conditions – which are typically from late fall to late winter.\n\tVehicles pulling trailers should never attempt driving past the upper OHV \"Open\" area parking/staging area.\n\tOpen fires are prohibited. Fires are restricted to camp stoves only.\n\tNo facilities or services are available.\n\tHigh clearance 4-wheel drive is highly recommender beyond the junction of the north end of paved Juniper Road and the very primitive OHV access road.

It breeds mostly in spring and summer and faces imminent extinction if its habitat is degraded. \n\n \n\n \n\nLearn more about the Amargosa Wild and Scenic River. \n\nHiking \n\n \n\nAlong the hiking loop, you will experience to exquisite natural beauty and rich cultural history of the Amargosa River. Look carefully to find evidence of the people who called this region home. You will follow the same path as those early explorers who came on the Old Spanish and Mormon Trails. Along the trail there are interpretive signs to guide your walk into this natural cultural gem of the Amargosa. \n\n \n\nThe trail is a 3.0 mile loop at a mild grade with even, hard-packed gravel. There is a possible, seasonal stream crossing to access the slot canyon trail at the top of the loop. \n\nKnow Before You Go \n\n Weather: The area is hot and arid, with summer high temperatures ranging from 100 to 120 degrees F. \n\nMake sure to pack plenty of water. \n\nWear sun protection even in Winter. There is very little  shade. \n\nPlease keep cats and dogs under control and out of the marshes. Any unrestrained dogs and cats can harass critically endangered species!  \n \n\n Please do not modify the pool banks or streams. Changing the pool shape or creating beaches removes sediment and disturbs vegetation.  \n \n\n No campfires. Even in a marsh, fire can be devastating and could remove all the dead vegetation nearby which many animals use for shelter.",

The upper story has windows on all four sides and provides a 360-degree view of the surrounding landscape.\n\nUntil 1932, the only access to the lookout site was by way of the Table Rock Trail through what is now Table Rock Wilderness.\n\nIncreased use of fire detection aircraft and improved road systems reduced the need for fire lookouts, and in 1964, it was determined that Pechuck was no longer needed as part of a fire suppression system.\n\nKnow Before You Go:\n\n\n\tThe Pechuck Lookout is open to the public for visitation and overnight use on a first-come, first-served basis.\n\tThe most scenic route to the lookout is from the Rooster Rock Trailhead on the southeast corner of the Table Rock Wilderness. This is a long, difficult, but scenic hike through old growth forest and pristine wilderness. The lookout is just outside the wilderness boundary. Good orientation skills, with a good map, are required to successfully complete this trip. It is also possible to walk up the long, steep, closed fire road from South Molalla River Road.\n\tOn a clear day, nearby Rooster Rock boasts incredible views of Table Rock and Mount Jefferson.\n\n\nPoint of Interest:\n\nOver the years, the BLM has partnered with several organizations to assist in management of the lookout. Pechuck Lookout was ultimately placed on the National Historic Lookout Register in 1990 and the World Fire Lookout Register in 1992. The lookout's style of stone and wood construction is highly distinctive, and it is the only stone lookout remaining in Oregon.",

This arm of the Raspberry Trail brings you back to the intersection encountered earlier. A right turn will bring you back to the trailhead on the Quarry Road. Because of the faded and missing sections of this loop this hike can be confusing to follow. For expereience dhikers it can present an interesting orienteering challenge.",

    "description": "Vogel Canyon is a scenic tributary of the Purgatorie River. Permanent springs at the bottom of the canyon support a variety of wildlife, which can best be seen early in the morning or just before sunset. Vogel Canyon has a rich history. American Indians lived in the canyon 300-800 years ago and left rock art which is visible on the canyon walls.During the 1870's, a spur off the Santa National Historic Fe Trail (between Las Animas and Trinidad) was developed by the Barlow and Sanderson Mail and Stage Line. Sections of the stage coach road and ruins of the station can still be found. Settled during the Depression Era, stone walled ruins from the Westbrook homestead still stand.Four hiking trails lead visitors through the riparian, canyonland and shortgrass prairie vegetation found in the canyon and surrounding plains.Facilities:3 covered picnic tables with grills (charcoal fires allowed in grills only)1 vault toilet4 hiking trails2 horse hitching railshorse trailer parkingNo drinking water Camping: Camping is allowed in the parking area only. However, no electricity, water or garbage containers are available.Trail safety: Please carry water with you. Spring water is not safe to drink.Look for cairns, or stone post, to help you locate the trails. Please stay on trails.Pay attention to the trail. Shortgrass prairie and rocky areas are home to rattlesnakes and cacti.Cultural resources on public lands are protected by lawAs you enter this area, please remember that you are the guardian of this unique canyon. Rock art, stone tools, charred bones, and rubble from dwellings provide evidence that people thrived on the Comanche National Grassland for thousands of years. Each relic of the past holds a clue that archaeologists use to reconstruct life here long ago. These cultural resources are ancient, fragile, and irreplaceable. If destroyed or removed, the information they reveal is lost forever. And so is a legacy that belongs to us all.Please do not touch rock art! Oils from your hands promote deterioration of the drawings and the rock surface. Do not draw or scratch graffiti on rocks or cliff faces. Graffiti defaces a fragile, irreplaceable legacy.All cultural resources on public lands are protected by law.

The site is unique for a variety of reasons. Most importantly, it makes archaeology and the study of ancient peoples accessible to the public. Since 1978, professional archaeologists have supervised members of the public in excavations, archaeological research techniques and artifact analysis through a variety of public and school programs.Major Trading SystemConveniently located on U.S. Highway 89 north, Elden Pueblo is thought to have been part of a major trading system. This is evidenced by discoveries of trade items, such as macaw skeletons from as far south as Mexico, to shell jewelry from the California Coast. Important discoveries recently uncovered at Elden Pueblo suggest that the Sunset Crater volcano may have erupted over a much longer period of time than previously thought.Elden Pueblo Trail GuideThe Arizona Natural History Association sponsors the Elden Pueblo Archaeology Project with the Coconino National Forest to provide opportunities for people to learn about and become involved in the science of archaeology.Annual programs include several Public Archaeology Days, in which the public can participate in site tours, actual excavation, artifact washing and analysis, and try their hand at using ancient hunting weapons.The August Public Day features a Primitive Technology Expo and the last Public Day of the year takes place in the fall as part of the annual Flagstaff Festival of Science.Elden Pueblo School ProgramsElden Pueblo is available for school programs and groups of up to thirty people. Educational programs are correlated to the Arizona State Standards, grades 4-7 in Social Science and Science.Custom programs are available, from 1-2 hours tours, to day-long excavations, or multiple-day programs.Elden Pueblo hosts the Arizona Archaeology Society’s summer field school, where avocational archaeologists receive training in various archaeological skills, such as excavation, stabilization, mapping, and laboratory techniques.There are also summer archaeology camps for students, from third grade and up.Additional InformationLearn more about Elden Pueblo, including a history of the Sinagua, programs, a glossary, frequently asked questions, and a list of references.",

This section of the trail passes through pinyon-juniper and scrub oak vegetation, with additional outstanding views of Deep Creek Point, Hadley Gulch, and the Clinetop Mesa. At 8 miles from the top, the trail reaches a bench and an intersection with the Main Elk Trail. The trail gradually descends to Forest Road 245 over the final 1.5 miles.  The Mansfield Ditch trail’s gentle grades and good views make it an excellent destination for mountain bikers, horseback riders, and hikers alike!View the Recreation Opportunity Guide for the Mansfield Ditch Trail (.pdf file).",

    "name": "Rogue River Ranch National Historic Site",
    "description": "Located at the mouth of Mule Creek and nestled in the heart of the National Wild and Scenic River’s wild section of the Rogue River, this historic site tells the story of the area’s transition from mining to recreation and conservation. \n\nHistory\n\nThe original structure was built in 1903, and it was quite the process in remote southwest Oregon. A neighbor felled trees for the homesteading Billings family when they decided to build a more permanent two-story dwelling. The windows needed were delivered via the O&C Railroad from Portland then carried by pack mules for 21 miles from Galice . The ranch and beautiful surroundings, much of which are public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management, remains just as remote today.\n\n\nThe building served as a base of operations for John Billings’ nearby mining operations along Mule Creek, but the family’s entrepreneurial efforts did not stop there. In addition to working the claim, the family also set up a general store that would sell commodities such as mining tools and coffee to local inhabitants of the rogue River Canyon.  The top story of the farmhouse was converted to a hotel that would service travelers and seasonal laborers traveling through the Rogue River Canyon.  In 1929 Elijah Pierce became the first postmaster of the Rogue River Canyon, and the Ranch was his first post office until it was moved to Illahe down river a few years later.\n\n \nDespite the difficult journey required to reach the ranch, it is obvious why humans have been drawn to the area for thousands of years. Seated at the confluence of Mule Creek and the Rogue River, the abundant water provided bountiful fishing opportunities for Native Americans, while the surrounding forests provided access not just to food resources, but also plants important for basket weaving and other necessities of prosperity. Archaeological excavations from nearby sites, mostly in the 1980s, show that Native American roots in the area go back about 10,000 years.\n\n\nThree generations of the Billings family lived at the site on the north bank of the Rogue, creating a community center of sorts for the area of Marial. In 1927, the family sold the property for $5,000 to the Andersons of Beverly Hills. The new owners invested heavily in the property, bringing some improvements and a little bit of Hollywood to the area. These improvements included a barn for their horses, a tack house, and a blacksmith shop. Perhaps their most important contribution was the improvement of the road accessing the ranch. Prior to their work on the road, it was a mule trail, unfit for cars. In 1970, the Anderson family was using the property less and less, and Federal Government was trying to acquire property along the newly designated Wild and Scenic River Program. The Andersons sold the property to the U.S. and in 1975, the Rogue River Ranch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The BLM is caretaker of the ranch, which is a must-stop attraction not just for rafters but backpackers on the Rogue River National Recreation Trail, too.\n\nKnow Before You Go:\n\n\n\tThe site is open from May through October.\n\tAccess is challenging. If you drive, be prepared with a full tank of gas and plenty of food and water. There are no fuel stations or services along the route. Drive with care as the roads are narrow and winding.\n\tPrimitive camping is available at the nearby Tucker Flat Campground.\n\n\nPoint of Interest\n\nIn an effort to preserve this heritage for all to enjoy, the BLM completed a substantial remodel of the main ranch house between 2017 and 2019. The remodel, which focused on improving visitor experience, developing formal museum exhibits, and improving interpretive signage, provides historic context and information on the unique lives of the area’s inhabitants through history. The museum is open now! If you're interested in visiting, you can access the area via boat, hike, or car.",

    "name": "1891 Schoolhouse",
    "description": "A short trail leads from the parking area to the site of the 1891 Schoolhouse, which operated along the Agua Fria River until 1903. On Sept. 12, 1891, U.S. Deputy Surveyor Francis B. Jacobs recorded a schoolhouse at this location along the Agua Fria River. Over 118 years later, Jacobs' map and field notes were rediscovered, spawning a search for information about the school and its location. Based on the 1891 survey map, the school was named the “1891 Schoolhouse.” Using field notes and the map as a guide, the location of the schoolhouse was identified. Although the building is gone, the sense of place is still intact. The remoteness and its history exemplify the need, importance, and desire of the settlers of Territorial Arizona for their children to get an education. Students would walk and ride horses and wagons to this distant location to meet in a single-room schoolhouse. Here they learned, played, and socialized in order to better themselves, their community and country.What once stood here?Although no photographs of the school are known to exist, a Yavapai County Superintendent’s Report for 1889-1890 states, “the school has sufficient school grounds that are suitably improved, was well ventilated, but poorly supplied with furniture and apparatus, and had no library, but a water closet.”Based on archaeological artifacts, the partial remains of the rock foundation, historical documentation, and known construction techniques used at other contemporaneous schools in the area, the following can be surmised about the schoolhouse: it measured approximately 16 feet by 28 feet, was a wooden frame structure with a wooden floor resting directly on a rock foundation, and most likely had vertical board siding. In addition, the school had multiple windows and, what as was custom of the time, a single entrance door.Students The students that attended the school were mostly from the local rural ranching and farming community within the school district, but students from outside the district were also enrolled. The ages of the students varied from 6 to 18 years old, and they were allowed to progress through their studies at their own pace, with younger students learning from the older ones. Enrollment varied from a low of 12 to a high of 24 students during the years of 1889 to 1903, with a fairly equal number of boys and girls. A number of the students went on to become teachers themselves, with some returning to the school to teach.School lifeThe first documented year of operation started on Sept. 9, 1889. The typical school year ran from five to eight months, starting on the second Monday in September. The school day lasted no more than six hours and only four hours for pupils under 8 years old. School started at 9 am and ended at 4 pm with a 20-minute recess in the morning and afternoon, during which students played games like ante-over, steal sticks, and baseball. The lunch hour started at noon, when the students would eat their lunches they brought from home in tin lard pails.The Cordes District #41 schoolhouse, also known as the “1891 Schoolhouse” ceased operation at the end of the 1903 school year. Declining enrollment ultimately resulted in the school's closing. Built as a public school by local families for their children, it provided the hope of a better and enriched future for their children and community. In addition to the standard curriculum of the time, the principles of morality, truth, justice and patriotism, free government, the rights, duties, and dignity of American citizenship were also impressed upon the students. The knowledge and principles the students gained perhaps helped transform a territory into a state on Feb. 14, 1912.Learn more at the Friends of the Agua Fria website.",

The roads are well-maintained dirt/gravel.\n\nCamping: Although this is not considered a camping destination, overnight stays are allowed in the designated parking area.\n\nActivities: Popular activities include visiting the historic site and hiking the self-guided trail.\n\nPoint of Interest:\n\nLovelock Cave is a site of historical significance known as the “Cradle of Great Basin Archaeology.”\n\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places, this unassuming cave was used by native peoples for thousands of years for shelter and storage.\n\nRecent History\n\nLovelock Cave first received broader attention in the 1910s by guano (bat dung) miners who found artifacts in the cave deposits. The find was reported to researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, and archaeological investigations began in 1912. Work continued intermittently in the cave through the 1960s.\n\nLovelock Cave was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 24, 1984.\n\nSince 2006, the BLM Humboldt River Field Office and local organizations sponsor “Lovelock Cave Days.” This event brings hundreds of elementary school students to Lovelock Cave where they can experience an important part of Nevada’s rich history.\n\nArtifacts\n\nThis is the original site of the famous Lovelock Cave duck decoys, which at 2,000 years old, are the oldest in the world. Among these, the “Tule Duck Decoy” is officially recognized as Nevada's State Artifact.\n\nThe oldest artifacts are attributed to the Northern Paiute, who likely first used the cave for storage and shelter thousands of years ago. The cave hosted over 10,000 artifacts such as baskets, textiles, and other tools. The cave was also found to contain human remains that are up to 4,000 years old. While some artifacts are on display at museums around the U.S., others have been repatriated to native tribes of Nevada.\n\nToday, the cave is empty of artifacts but allows us to visit the site of their important rediscovery.\n\nKnow Before You Go:\n\n\n25 mph is recommended along the entrance road.\nBring sturdy footwear, water, and a flashlight to view the cave.\nInterpretive trail brochures are in a metal box mounted to the information kiosk.\nThis site is remote.\nThere is no drinking water.\nThere is limited cell coverage.\nTemperatures can fluctuate quickly.\nAnimals may roost in the cave. Their movements can be startling, so please watch your footing.\nWatch for rattlesnakes, especially in warmer months when they seek cool places under rocks and bushes.\nThis site is important to many people still living today.\nPlease dispose of litter, leave any found artifacts, and report vandalism or other disruptive behaviors to the Winnemucca District Office.",

As the ice melted from within this formation of rock and soil, a landscape of rolling hills and wetlands developed known as the Missouri Coteau. The Lostwood Wilderness is located in the Missouri Coteau and is dominated by northern mixed grass prairie. Over 100 species of grasses can be found in this area and numerous species of wildflowers brighten the landscape from April through August. Lostwood Wilderness is home to an abundance of breeding waterfowl as well as many species of grassland dependent songbirds including, Baird’s, La Conte’s, grasshopper, and savannah sparrows, and Sprague’s pipit. \nThe climate of this area is typical of the Northern Great Plains, with annual precipitation ranging from 12-17 inches. Typically the months of May and June receive the most moisture with the remaining summer months hot and dry. It is not uncommon to exceed temperatures of 100 degrees Fahrenheit during the summer months and 20-30 degrees below zero during the winter. With few natural land barriers the wind moves freely across the Plains with speeds often 5-20mph and 25-35mph winds are not uncommon. \n\nThe 27,589-acre Lostwood National Wildlife Refuge protects some of the best native prairie in North Dakota.

All of the Wilderness is in the state of Maine. In 1970 the Moosehorn Wilderness became part of the now over 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System.\nEvery year thousands of migratory birds hitch a ride on the Eastern (Atlantic) Flyway, which spans the skies from Maine to Florida. At the northernmost end of the route, many disembark at 23,000-acre Moosehorn National Wildlife Refuge. Although trees in this region have been significantly logged in the past, today a diverse forest stands here, a woodland of aspen, maple, birch, spruce, and fir with scattered stands of white pine. Once scoured heavily by glaciers, the land of the refuge is primarily low, rolling hills dotted with many lakes, bogs, marshes, streams, and rocky outcroppings. \nEstablished in 1937, Moosehorn is the only refuge where people study and manage the American woodcock, a reclusive bird that hides in dense cover of young forests during the day, feeds in clearings at night, and flies an amazing courtship ritual in spring. Bald eagles frequent the refuge, and black bears and white-tailed deer are common. In November, deer hunting is allowed. Despite the name, moose are not as common as you would expect. Ducks, geese, and loons congregate on more than 50 lakes. \n\nThe Wilderness is divided into two units: Edmunds and Birch Islands, both on the rocky Maine coast. \n\nAlong the several miles of coast of the Edmunds Unit, 24-foot tidal fluctuations are normal, but only the island portion of the Wilderness is affected. A loop road passes along the boundary of the inland Wilderness, and several old roads give miles of access to the area. Off the old roads, bushwhacking through heavy brush can be a nightmare. \n\nSee also the separately designated Moosehorn (Baring Unit) Wilderness.",

There is a special feeling of wildness about this place, Tamarac, best expressed by the eerie howl of a wolf, mournful wail of a loon, or the drumming of a ruffed grouse from deep within the forest. \nTamarac National Wildlife Refuge is located in the glacial lake country of northwestern Minnesota. It was established in 1938 as a refuge breeding ground for migratory birds and other wildlife. Tamarac is a land of rolling forested hills interspersed with lakes, rivers, marshes, bogs and shrub swamps. The token of the refuge is the Tamarack tree. This unusual tree is a deciduous conifer, turning brilliant gold before losing its needles each fall. Tamarac’s wilderness consists of four sections of the 42,738- acre refuge: three islands in Tamarac Lake (totaling 65 acres in the southwest section) and the 2000 acre northwest corner. Here you will find stands of mature white pines, a favorite nesting tree of bald eagles. \n\nHistorically, the refuge was a prized hunting, fishing, ricing and maple sugaring area for Native American tribes. The Sioux once controlled the area followed by the Ojibwe. Today the northern half of the refuge lies within the original White Earth Indian Reservation established in 1867. Tribal members continue to hunt, fish, trap and harvest herbs, berries and wild rice on the refuge. \n\nTamarac lies in the heart of one of the most diverse transition zones in North America, where northern hardwood, coniferous forests and the tall grass prairie converge. This diversity of habitat brings with it a wealth of wildlife. There are over 250 species of birds and 50 species of mammals. Spring on the refuge attracts a magnificent warbler migration and fall is highlighted with an abundance of waterfowl including more than 15,000 ring-necked ducks at its peak. Bald eagles are common and wolves are occasionally seen. Tamarac is one of the premier production areas for trumpeter swans in the lower 48 states. The refuge also provides critical nesting habitat for golden-winged warblers, a Species of Concern whose population has declined steadily over the past 35 years due to loss of habitat. Other wildlife include black bear, porcupine, mink, fisher, otter and beaver. \n\nThe northwest wilderness area is part of the sanctuary which is open September-February.The wilderness does not have established hiking trails and overnight camping is prohibited. \n\nWith the brilliant fall colors of aspen, maple, oak, birch and tamarack interspersed with evergreens, Autumn truly is a beautiful time to experience the wilderness of Tamarac.",

This was a mining town that failed due to nonproducing mines and transportation problems. Parts of the town are private property, so pack out all your trash and observe posted trespassing signs.  Stunner Campground is beside the Alamosa River 2 miles below the top of Stunner Pass. There are 10 campsites with tables, fireplaces, vault type toilet, ample parking and a developed water system operated with a hand pump. Firewood is limited. Convenient trailer spaces available. The Alamosa River is nearby for fishing, unfortunately, naturally acidic water severely limits fishing in the Alamosa River between Stunner Campground and Terrace Reservoir. Big game hunting is possible. Stunner is a ghost town of historic significance. Please pack your trash. Obtain permission before entering any private property in the area.  Stunner, never very big, has long been a ghost town with ghost mines on both sides of the Alamosa. The names of its mines have a special flavor -- the Orpheus, Cornucopia, the Merrimac, Log Cabin, and Snow Storm, and as always, a mine named for a wife, daughter or sweetheart, the Louise. Only those mines north of the river shipped payable ore; those south, shipped no ore. Stunner, like the Platoro camp south across the mountain to the left, had transportation problems. The government road had washed out by 1885 and was not repaired because of the discontinuance of the forts at Fort Garland and at Pagosa Springs, and the construction of a railroad over Cumbres Pass to the south. This meant mail was delivered by pack trains and post riders in the summer and on skis in the winter.  The ink-blue, fringed gentians bloom in the meadow in late August.

The trail passes through dense forests of standing dead trees, killed or weakened by either the fire or bark beetle infestation. For example, over two weeks in June, a district trail crew cleared approximately 250 dead and downed trees lying across the first five miles of the trail between the trailhead and hot springs.About half of the West Fork Trail between the trailhead and hot springs is impacted and may pose safety issues, and conditions currently make travel by pack animals dangerous in certain sections. One portion of the trail near the hot springs is washed out and not recommended for stock travel at this time. Wilderness crews plan to work on this section this month to try to improve conditions. In addition, burned-out stumps have left multiple large holes along one mile of the trail between the first two bridge crossings, also making stock travel treacherous and foot travel difficult. The bridges, however, are in good shape, although one bridge did sustain damage from a falling dead tree. Its hand rails have been rebuilt and the bridge inspected.Visitors are also reminded that camping near the hot springs can be dangerous because the root systems of the multiple standing dead trees in the area may not be intact and are very susceptible to wind throw. Past the hot springs, Forest Service crews have cleared standing dead trees along switchbacks, but at the top of the pass, the trail is washed out and deemed impassable to stock travel. In addition, crews have not yet cleared downed trees across the trail past the switchbacks.",

With good fishing for rainbow and brook trout, Little Cultus is a great place to take the family for a quiet weekend of fishing and camping. Rainbow trout angling, 11-17 inches are the primary fishery. Brook trout stocking ended in 1997 but some fish up to 16 inches are still found.Little Cultus' gently sloping shorelines are easily wadable. The deepest spots, up to 60 feet deep, are in the center of the lake. Angler’s troll flashers with a trailing night crawler or use single lures, such as a gold Thomas lure or yellow Rooster Tail. Trolling slowly along drop-offs is a commonly used technique here. Bank fishing is best along the north shore of the lake, using bobbers and worms, spinners, spoons, or a marshmallow and worm fished near the bottom. The fish at Little Cultus Lake often surface feed on emerging damselflies and mayflies. Fly fishers should be well prepared with mayfly dries, ant imitations in sizes 10 to 14, damsel nymph imitations, and Woolly Buggers. Searching the shallower areas of the lake with wet flies, early and late in the day is especially effective.Little Cultus Lake offers a quiet, wooded area with primitive camping. Road surfaces are dirt or gravel.

Dense thickets of willow and brush follow the stream course. Hillsides are dominated by mixed conifer and stands of park-like ponderosa pine. Ridge-tops are predominantly open sagebrush with some mountain mahogany. Deer and elk are common year round. The lucky observer may also see bear, coyote, mountain lion, or possibly wolverines! Beware of rattlesnakes, especially in stream bottoms.Walk down through geologic time, from the rim to Black Canyon creek, from Boeing Field to the South Fork of the John Day River; each successive basalt flow is older than the last. Black Canyon Wilderness is a layer cake of 17 million-year-old Picture Gorge Basalt flows, stacked one on top of the other.The 18 miles of maintained trail offer easy access throughout the wilderness. Be prepared to ford streams as there are no bridges. The 12-mile Black Canyon Trail (#820) cuts through a narrow gorge, requiring hikers to cross rushing water at least a dozen times. The creek is typically un-fordable at high water, usually January through March. Three short side trails join the Black Canyon Trail.  There have been two large wild fires in the area within the last decade encompassing most of the wilderness.Elevation range: 2,850' - 6,483'Trail map: View a Black Canyon Wilderness area trails map (.pdf)Key access points: Trail and trailhead access information.embed-container {position: relative; padding-bottom: 80%; height: 0; max-width: 100%;} .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container iframe{position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;} small{position: absolute; z-index: 40; bottom: 0; margin-bottom: -15px;}View larger map",

    "description": "The southwest-tending drainage of Mill Creek makes up 85 percent of the Wilderness, with Marks Creek drainage accounting for the difference. Both creeks are tributaries of Ochoco Creek, and home to small trout. The steep, broken ridges that drop into Mill Creek rise to Bingham Prairie in the northwest corner, a virtually flat plateau with open meadows and a lodgepole pine forest.In 2000, a lightning caused wildfire burned over half of the 17,4000 acre Wilderness. Though much of the fire burned at a stand replacement, high intensity, the area is quickly recovering and there are still some examples of an exemplary climax forest (one that has reached its peak of growth) of ponderosa pine, providing habitat for elk, mule deer, bobcats, mountain lions, and the occasional black bear.Mill Creek Wilderness resides within the 40 million year old Wildcat Mountain Caldera.  Two eroded volcanic spires distinguish the northwest-central portion:  Twin Pillars, with vertical walls rising 200 dramatic feet above the forest is a rhyolite intrusion into the caldera, and 400-foot Steins Pillar, just outside the southwestern boundary is an erosional remnant of the Tuffs of Steins Pillar that filled the caldera basin.  North of Twin Pillars lays the rugged, rocky Desolation Canyon, aptly named since its lack of trails discourages most human visitors.Four trailheads provide access to approximately 18 miles of trails, each located adjacent to small, rustic campgrounds.  The trails can be accessed at Twin Pillars North Trailhead, Twin Pillars South Trailhead, Wildcat North Trailhead and Wildcat South Trailhead. Elevation: 3,700' to 6,200'Key access points: Trail and trailhead access informationTrail Map: View a Mill Creek Wilderness trail vicinity map (.pdf).embed-container {position: relative; padding-bottom: 80%; height: 0; max-width: 100%;} .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container iframe{position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;} small{position: absolute; z-index: 40; bottom: 0; margin-bottom: -15px;}View larger map",

The peaks of East Point and North Point look across the wilderness from 6,625 feet and 6,607 feet, respectively.The benches and springs in Bridge Creek are the result of massive landslides, heavy basalts cascading down weathered clay zones within the underlying volcanic terrain. Pisgah Lookout sits up on basalt rim, overlooking the wilderness.The forest is mostly fir and larch with streaks of pine and clearings of sagebrush and bunchgrass. Stands of white fir and lodgepole pine are found in the central core of the wilderness. Most of the 30 inches of annual precipitation falls as winter snow. There are five perennial springs in the wilderness, including the Thompson, Pisgah, Masterson, Nelson, and Maxwell springs. Wildlife prominent in the area include elk, coyote, rabbit and many raptors and cavity nesting birds.Orientation skills are a must for traveling because there are no maintained trails in Bridge Creek Wilderness. Off-trail hiking through the tangled understory tends to be difficult. Wind has stunted the trees and opened the country around North Point; a hike of about 1.2 miles from near Pisgah Springs along an abandoned jeep track will take you to the summit. Another abandoned trail leads about 1.5 miles to the summit of East Point.In 2008, the Bridge Creek Fire burned most of the wilderness to stand replacement conditions. It is now more accessible with greater line-of-sight vistas. Please use caution as many trees have been weakened and present additional danger.Elevation range: 5,200' to 6,607'Key access points: Bridge Creek Wilderness access information.embed-container {position: relative; padding-bottom: 80%; height: 0; max-width: 100%;} .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container iframe{position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;} small{position: absolute; z-index: 40; bottom: 0; margin-bottom: -15px;}View larger map",

Chino Valley is also very involved in managing the Upper Verde River Area, habitat of some sensitive and endangered species. Ashes, willows, and cottonwood trees are common vegetation types found along the river banks.Although the Chino Valley Ranger District does not have developed recreation sites, dispersed recreation is allowed anywhere on forest unless posted otherwise. One of the most heavily used recreation areas on the west side of the District is Camp Wood, located in the pines at an elevation of 5,700 feet. Approximately one mile north of Camp Wood is a riparian area, Emerald Glade, which is host to a variety of wildlife. This area was created by a masonry silt retention structure as part of our forest's wildlife habitat improvement program. The popular camping areas on the east side of the District are along the headwaters of the Verde River. The most popular trail is Sycamore Trail, located in the Sycamore Canyon Wilderness.In addition to Sycamore Canyon, three other wilderness areas are located within the district: Juniper Mesa Wilderness and Apache Creek Wilderness on the west side, Woodchute Wilderness on the east side.

The vast majority of this alpine area is forested, ranging from stands of ponderosa pine mixed with Gambel Oak at lower altitudes, to alpine spruce and fir near the summit. Much of the steeper parts of Kendrick contain old growth forest that contributes valuable habitat for the Mexican spotted owl, bear, and Northern goshawk. Wildflower covered meadows break the tree cover at a number of places, providing forage for mule deer and elk as well as viewpoints and lunch spots for forest visitors. Kendrick Mountain is one of many remnants of the vast San Francisco Mountain volcanic field that stretches from near Seligman on the west and east beyond Flagstaff to Canyon Diablo.

This rugged desert canyon is so remote and so unique it was one of the first areas in Arizona to be officially designated and protected as wilderness by the U.S. Congress. The upper reaches of Sycamore Canyon lie at the southeastern edge of the Kaibab National Forest. A limited number of forest roads and trails provide access.The Sycamore Trail skirts the canyon&#39;s upper reaches and provides a number of jumping off places for further exploration. Although mountain bikes and other vehicles are excluded from the wilderness, the Sycamore Canyon Scenic drive and bike route provides an excellent vantage for enjoying the scenery it holds.

Within these walls lies a maze of water and wind carved fins, knobs, potholes, and other intricately sculptured forms. Elevations range from near 2,000 feet at the river to 6,000 feet at the rim's edge. The upper reaches serve as a winter range for the Kaibab mule deer. Vegetation is varied and sparse except for heavy riparian growth in the creek bottom. There are few dependable water sources here for man or beast during the summer months when temperatures approach 120 degrees. A number of trails lead into this rather hostile environment but many are poorly marked and infrequently maintained.

At this time of year the woods, water, flora and fauna are richly picturesque. Campgrounds are in their grandeur and are not crowded. Fishing for salmon and trout is excellent.The Hiawatha has over 30 varieties of trees which provide a rainbow of colors. The maple, oak, birch, beech, and aspen provide the reds, golds and yellows. The pines, spruce, hemlock and cedar provide the greens and the lakes provide different hues of blue.Hike the many trails or drive the network of roads throughout the forest. Use this guide for your auto tour or pick up additional information on camping and hiking at our area offices listed below. It is a good idea to also pick up a detailed map of the Forest. The map shows towns, points of interest, and picnic and camping areas.Please remember that the roads through a forest may be gravel or dirt and may be single or double lane. Please drive carefully.WHY THE COLORSLeaves turn colors when the primary pigment of chlorophyll disappears. Chlorophyll is used by plants for food and makes the leaves green. Less and less chlorophyll is produced as the fall season approaches. As the chlorophyll disappears the other pigments in the leaves become visible.

Minnetonka is one of two caverns administered by the Forest Service. Within St. Charles Canyon are campgrounds and a large group use areas with fishing and hiking nearby. Keep an eye out for resident wildlife such as moose and deer.Attention! In an attempt to keep White Nose Syndrome (a bat disease) from spreading into Minnetonka Cave, please DO NOT wear clothing or hand carried items into Minnetonka Cave that you have worn or carried in any other cave or mine. These things include – shoes, hats, belts, jewelry, cameras, backpacks, cell phones, purses, etc. Any individuals who bring items with them that have been in another cave or mine will not be able to take the tour. We appreciate your cooperation and hope you enjoy your tour.Due to the westward spread of White Nose syndrome (WNS), restrictions on clothing and items that have been in other caves are currently in place at Minnetonka Cave to prevent introduction of this bat disease into Idaho. It is possible for humans to spread the disease between caves if clothing or equipment has been exposed to the fungus. Leaving clothing or other items that have been in another cave at home, will help protect bat species inhabiting Minnetonka Cave. Introduction of this disease into Minnetonka Cave would devastate local bat populations, and in the event of a cave closure, greatly impact local economies.

Approximately 1 mile up the windy single lane paved road you will find the staging area and the end of the pavement. Access: Campfires and the use of stoves require a California Campfire Permit, available from any Forest Service office. Backcountry hiking into Desolation Wilderness requires a visitor use permit. The trail usually is free of snow by late June and remains open until the weather closes it again during October or November. Attractions and Considerations: This nationally known, difficult, 4x4 route leads from Loon Lake to Lake Tahoe, a distance of approximately 22 miles. The narrow passages, rocky climbs and an occasional mud hole keep the trail rated as Most Difficult. The trail is recommended for short wheelbase vehicles with all skid plates in place, and even then, you can expect scratches and/or dents. There are restrooms located at the trailhead. Good fishing and camping are found at Miller, Buck, and Richardson Lakes. A world class OHV road with a variety of Mountain Biking opportunities from loop rides to difficult peak climbs. There is a county ordinance that closes the trail the last weekend of July and the first weekend of August for the annual Jeepers Jamboree.",

    "description": "The Richland Creek Wilderness was created by the 1984 Arkansas Wilderness Act and contains 11,801 acres in the middle of the Boston Mountains. One of three wildernesses on the Buffalo Ranger District, it takes its name from the main creek running through the area with the rich, fertile soil along the lower creek portion near the Buffalo River. An unusual feature of the Ozark Mountains is that the “mountains” are actually plateaus, uplifted as a unit with few folds or faults. The ruggedness of these mountains is due to erosion of the plateaus caused by swift rivers flowing between them. Topography within 1/4 mile on either side of Richland and Long Devil’s Fork Creeks is quite rugged and scenic. Rock bluffs over 100 feet high and extending over a mile along each side of Richland Creek graphically reveal the earth’s development. The forest cover is mostly second and third growth oak-hickory. Some scattered stands of shortleaf pine in old fields exist from when the Forest Service purchased the land in the 1930s and 1940s. There are no developed trails located in the wilderness. There is a system of old logging roads that run throughout the area and receive sporadic use. Kayakers float Richland Creek after rains have raised the creek water level. The wilderness area is known for its crystal clear creeks and waterfalls. Remember to take drinking water or a filtration device with you for your safety.",

Be sure to check with current Arizona fishing regulations for this site before your visit.Often you are the only visitor at the lake; there are several dispersed camping areas that are seldom occupied. The Aker Lake trail is 3.5 miles that will take you to the Hannagan campground; this is a good trail for mountain biking as well as hiking and horseback riding.",

The area is currently open to public use and entry, HOWEVER -  trails may not yet been assessed or maintained for hazards associated with the fire.  Please keep in mind that any area affected by the wildfire can be prone to hazards such as falling trees, flooding and burned out stump holes. The environment you are entering is highly susceptible to rainstorms and wind events. Any time you enter the forest, you should be aware of your environment and changing weather conditions. You are responsible for your own safety! Always look up, look down, and look all around.In 1540, the Spanish explorer Francisco Vasquez de Coronado was the first European to travel through the area, and his journal writer described it as a huge trackless wilderness.  In 1825 Mountain man James Ohio Pattie visited the Blue Range trapping beaver and marveled at the number of clear running streams, the lush vegetation of the canyons, and the plentiful wildlife. In 1905 Forest Service Employee W.H.B. Kent described the Blue Range as “no discernible mountain range, but rather a chaotic mass of very precipitous hills”.In 1933 the Secretary of Agriculture proclaimed that the Blue Range should be managed for primitive uses to maintain the wildness of that area. In 1971, the President of the United States forwarded a recommendation for the Blue Range Wilderness in New Mexico and Arizona to Congress, who acted in 1980 on a portion of it, designating the Blue Range Wilderness in New Mexico. The Blue Range Primitive Area is the last designated primitive area in the National Forest System. The Blue Range and the presidential recommendation additions together total 199,505 acres and by law are managed the same as congressionally designated wilderness.Located on the edge of the Mogollon Rim and the breaks of the Blue River, this is a land of rugged mountains, steep canyons, and stark ridges that is at the same time remote and accessible through an extensive trail system. Elevations range from 4,500 feet in the southern portion to 9,100 feet along the rim. This rapid change in elevation results in interesting and unique ecological associations.",

The Great Sanhedrin was the supreme council of the ancient Hebrews and the imposing ridge that crowns this Wilderness was named after that high council. The terrain in this area is moderately steep and rugged. The Wilderness is managed by the Forest Service, but includes areas of private land.Elevations in the Wilderness vary from 6,175 feet at Big Signal peak to 1,600 along Thomas Creek. The major creeks in the area drain westward to the Eel River. Soils are moderately to highly erodible, and an unstable fault zone transects the Rocky Point-Ascherman Ranch area.Trails in the SanhedrinDeveloped trails do not exist within the Sanhedrin at this time, providing a truly untrammeled Wilderness experience. The only public access point for this area is by the lookout on Big Signal Peak at the end of Forest Road 20N04. From this location, visitors can enjoy off trail hunting, hiking, and camping activities.Although you may come across an old road or cattle trail while visiting the Sanhedrin, no managed trails existed upon designation of the Wilderness. Employees and wilderness stewardship volunteers have begun to identify potential opportunities to designate and maintain foot and horse trails in the Sanhedrin for future use and enjoyment.We recommend that when visiting the area you bring the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5-minute topographic maps that cover the region:  USGS maps for the Sanhedrin Wilderness include Sanhedrin Mountain, Brushy Mountain, Foster Mountain, and Van Arsdale Reservoir.

The seed produced not only benefits ecological restoration efforts, it also provides for wildfire recovery, watershed restoration, riparian habitat for threatened and endangered species, Native American culture values, recreation areas, and forest health including research and disease resistance.The secondary function is to provide for recreation, public service and education.  Recreational activities include taking a stroll down a self-guided mile long paved accessible nature trail, dog walking (leash laws apply), wildlife and bird watching, and picnicking at one of seven established sites. The site contains one restroom and trash services but does not provide drinking water for the public.

Today's picnic area was once the site of the first developed campground in the U.S. Forest Service, with facilities that were later rebuilt during the Great Depression by the Civilian Conservation Corps structures. On site remains the famous historic restroom (currently closed) nicknamed \"Big John.\" The 1916 structure was the first flush toilet in the U.S. Forest Service. Look for the historic Community Kitchen Pavilion perched on the hillside, which is wheelchair accessible. Stone ovens and an old trail register sit on the road to the trailhead. All the site's historic structures were saved by firefighters in 2017, when a massive wildfire known as Eagle Creek Fire started on nearby Eagle Creek Trail #440 (still closed for repairs).A lovely suspension bridge which once allowed hikers to cross Eagle Creek for the Gorge Trail #400 and Wauna Viewpoint Trail #402 did not fare so well in the fire. Intense heat snapped a cable, causing the bridge to warp, so it was removed to prevent further damage to the downstream hatchery and other infrastructure. The Forest Service is working on plans to replace the bridge but there is no timeline yet for reopening.Due to post-fire hazards on the landscapes, many other area trails including Ruckel Creek Trail #405 are still closed while crews clear and stabilize trails.The roads have tight curves, so trailers longer than 20 feet trailer cannot fit into this recreation area.The paved Historic Columbia River Highway State Trail, great for road biking or a scenic run, runs to the town of Cascade Locks to the east and runs west to connect with the Historic Columbia River Highway Waterfall Corridor (where bikes must share the road with cars). The state-run Cascade Hatchery is located onsite, offering self-guided tours. During the fall, visitors can view chinook and coho salmon spawning at Eagle Creek. Please protect spawning salmon by  looking without touching. Do not throw rocks or poke salmon with sticks and stay out of the creek during spawning season.Salmon CAM!The salmon spawning season is here and the USDA Forest Service, Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area provides a new way to watch all the action as the Chinook (King) Salmon prepare to spawn. Fisheries personnel have placed an underwater webcam in a pool of Eagle Creek, a tributary to the Columbia River, where Chinook are gathering prior to spawning. While Chinook Salmon are present now, later in the autumn you can also observe Coho Salmon.   -->",

The axe was king, and engineering feats in the mountains included lumber mills, water flumes, steam locomotives, and unrivalled will power. This grove is the largest contiguous grove in the world and contains Boole Tree, the largest sequoia on National Forest System land. This grove offers unique opportunities to study how rapidly the young sequoias grow. Unlike most of the planet&rsquo;s other species, sequoias reproduce prolifically and continue to grow rapidly well into old age. Converse Basin also offers the importance of studying historic weather patterns created from the timelines on tree rings located on the stumps.Nearby Campgrounds: Princess Campground (GPS NAD 83: 36.80278, -118.93694)In the late 1800s, the Converse Basin Grove was under private ownership, and was harvested extensively during our country&rsquo;s historic logging period. Several groups of sequoias escaped the 1880s logging. Much of the grove was cut down, denuded and the land was later sold to the U.S. Forest Service. Today, the grove has recovered and it is breathtaking!Recreation Opportunities: There are quite of few areas to get out and explore! Hume Lake, Drive the Kings Canyon Scenic Byway, or camp nearby in Princess Campground. There are also a few dispersed camping areas which people are welcome to use, please check with the Hume Lake Ranger District office.Three prominent developed recreation sites lie within Converse Basin Grove; the Boole Tree Trail, Chicago Stump Trail, and Stump Meadow. For the history buffs, buy a copy of the book, They Felled the Redwoods which has extensive historical information.Boole Tree Trail is a moderate 2.5 mile loop to the Boole Tree. There are restroom facilities at the trailhead, but no drinkable water. Boole, the largest giant sequoia on National Forest System Land, is the 8th largest of all known sequoias. This trail offers spectacular views of the Kings River gorge and spectacular high Sierra Nevada mountain vistas. As you travel along the trail, you&rsquo;ll come across remains of sequoias left where they fell in the historic logging days.Chicago Stump Trail is an easy .5 mile loop to the stump. The trail meanders along a meadow ringed by young sequoias. Chicago Stump was originally known as the General Noble tree. In 1897, it was cut down in pieces, the pieces were numbered shipped, and reassembled at the Chicago World&rsquo;s Fair. People were astounded by the giant&rsquo;s size and believed the reassembled giant was made of several trees and call it the &ldquo;California Hoax&rdquo;.For the experienced hiker: A daring hike down to the Cabin Creek Grove will dwarf you while hiking among the old monarch sequoias. This small pocket of sequoias was untouched during the historic logging period in Converse Basin Grove. It is very steep and difficult to get to.Stump Meadow: On the drive to the Boole Tree you will pass a meadow filled with sequoia stumps that demonstrate both the size of the trees, and the historic logging that took place. Today, thousands of the young spiral topped sequoia which are about 100 years old, surround the meadow. Scientists speculate on why this meadow area has not regenerated like the rest of the grove. These stumps provide a wealth of knowledge to scientists studying weather patterns by studying the tree rings. The science of dendrochronology uses tree rings to reconstruct past events, such as weather patterns, fires, droughts or other significant events which impact a tree&rsquo;s life. The oldest known sequoia stump in Converse Basin Grove is just over 3,200 years old.&nbsp;",

Before the Forest Service acquired the grove in the 1930s the area was privately owned. Between 1901 and 1907 the Sanger Lumber Company removed all the mature trees including the ancient giant sequoias. Lumbermen hauled the trees by cable railways over Converse Mountain and down the backside of the mountain to the historic Converse Mill. Massive, giant sequoia stumps remain as silent reminders of the great trees that once grew here.Young giant sequoias have replaced many of the giants that fell to the saw demonstrating the species resilience. In tree ring studies, the stumps continue to help scientists piece together prehistoric and historic weather patterns, fires and droughts. The grove is easy to reach by car on State Highway 180. It is best to visit in the summer because the road can be snowy and icy in the winter. The grove is about 215 acres with sequoias mainly on the south side of Indian Basin Creek.",

You are now in the lower half of the Belknap Camp Grove of sequoias. There are several recent (1983) giant windfalls here and the gentle slopes of the area make it a fine picnic spot. Two of the giants are almost at right angles to one another and a spring is located within their embrace, perhaps 150 feet from the corner intersection. Out of the bark of these fallen goliaths, which make wonderful scenic rest stops, sprout many young firs, pines and even sequoias.Should you loose the trail, proceed up-slope to the top of the ridge (about 1/2 mile, but it will seem like 5 or 10) where you will meet the fairly well maintained COY FLAT - BEAR RIDGE TRAIL (31E31).If you are still on the trail you will come to a \"Y\" where you can take the left trail on up to the upper half of the Sequoia grove, where you will pass several really large trees.

Close proximity to Los Angeles and Bakersfield makes this lake a popular yearround vacation spot for southern Californians. The lake is one of the state’s most popular windsurfing areas; reliable afternoon winds, from 35-50 miles an hour, create ideal conditions for intermediate to advanced windsurfers.

South Fork Wildlife Area, one of the most extensive riparian woodlands remaining in California, provides fishing, hunting, canoeing, and hiking opportunities; no developed recreation facilities are located here. When operating on the lake, every boat, personal watercraft, and sailboard must display a permit from Kern County. These permits may be obtained at any lake marina or at various locations throughout the Kern River Valley. Be sure to check for required safety equipment.Isabella Dam Safety Modification ProjectThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is currently designing a dam safety modification project to address seismic, hydrologic (potential overtopping during an extreme flood event) and seepage issues at the dams.Until the dam is repaired, the Corps has put in place several interim risk reduction measures, such as increased surveillance and monitoring; stockpiling of emergency materials; warning sirens in the town of Lake Isabella; installation of additional instrumentation for monitoring; and continued public outreach with Kern County and the local public. One additional measure includes an operating restriction, limiting the pool elevation for safety purposes. However, due to lower than average rainfall and snowmelt, the reservoir has only come close to its restricted level once since its implementation.  The current low water levels (summer 2013) are not related to the operating restriction. See historic water levels here: http://1.usa.gov/10EdOgaIn 2012, the Corps unveiled to the public its plan for retrofitting the dam and reducing the risk to the public, which includes raising both dams up to 16 feet to prevent overtopping during extreme flood events; filtering and drainage systems to safely control seepage; lining and treatment of existing spillway; and construction of an emergency spillway. The Corps is now in the Pre-Construction Engineering and Design phase of the project. Physical construction is scheduled to begin in 2017.

Baden-Powell. The trail is the most difficult route to the summit but is the most popular way to reach the top. This 8-mile trek features 35 switchbacks up the north face of one of the tallest mountains in the San Gabriels. Those attempting this \"must-do\" hike will find the beginning part of the hike the most difficult with the rest being slightly easier. The trail will take backpackers under the spine of the ridge through stands of Jeffrey, Ponderosa, and Lodgepole pines. What's more, be sure to stop and admire the 1,500-year-old Limber pine at the timberline. Fun fact: Mt. Baden-Powell is named after Lord Robert Baden-Powell in 1931. He was the founder of the modern Boy Scouts and as such the trail is well-maintained by Boy Scout groups. A monument lies in his honor near the summit of his named mountain.",

Western red cedar and Pacific yew occur in wet lowlands while higher ridges have some Engelmann spruce and mountain hemlock. Common hardwoods include big leaf maple and red alder. Understory vegetation includes huckleberry, vine maple and rhododendron. Various bird species, deer, black bear, cougars and elk use the wilderness area in the summer months.There are eight trails totaling 36 miles. These are remnants of the early day prospecting and fire access routes. Most are single destination, in-out trails with little opportunity for loop travel. Many end at old lookout sites which provide some views. Other trails traverse both the Opal Creek Wilderness and Opal Creek Scenic Recreation Area.Because of the remoteness and steep topography, very little overnight camping occurs.Special regulations are in place to help protect this area and preserve the experience for you and for future visitors.

And don&#39;t forget the trail down into the Huckleberry Lake basin. The area is rich in history, scenic delights, and is an altogether wonderful site.",

Lush bluegrass lawns beneath towering pine and spruce, sparkling water fountains, gardens of native and cultivated flowers blooming throughout the summer enhanced the picturesque setting. In 1883, millionaire James V. Dexter, expanded Lakeside into a world-class resort, re-named the hotel Interlaken, and added 2,000 acres.Relative luxury in a rustic mountain setting provided escape for the wealthy. Guests first journeyed by train to Granite (five miles east of Twin Lakes) where they boarded a side-seated platform wagon to the resort. A boardwalk led them from the stage stop to the hotel porch.Culture was not forgotten at this rustic resort. Every week during the summer an orchestra came from Leadville to play in the pavilion, where oil paintings of the Civil War covered the walls. Billiard tables, inlaid with rare woods and ivory, provided another luxury. Guests could also spend their days playing cards, picnicking, horseback riding or hiking. Activites such as skating, skiing, and sleigh riding continued through the winter. Sleds driven by teams of horses brought visitors from Leadville across the frozen lake.&nbsp;This area does not allow camping.

The Sawtooth Wilderness is exceptional in scenic beauty and is characterized by high granite peaks and narrow glacial valleys. The Wilderness is comprised of hundeds of jagged peaks, 50 over 10,000 feet in height, with nearly 400 high alpine lakes dotting the predominantly rocky terrain.  Also hidden within its boundaries are deep, secluded valleys covered with enormous stands of trees. These mountains hold the headwaters of the North Fork and Middle Fork of the Boise River, the South Fork of the Payette River and contributes significantly to the headwaters of the Salmon River. Nearly 350 miles of trails provide a wide range of routes and many of the high lake basins do not have constructed trails to reach them. The hiking season is short. Alpine wildflowers bring the high meadows alive with color in the months of July and August. An abundant population of wildlife thrives upon the lush, grassy meadows and many species of fish make their home in the thousands of streams that feed the headwaters of four major rivers.  The Wilderness offers opportunities for recreational, scenic, scientific, educational, conservation and historic purposes.",

This road was built using a small caterpillar and horse drawn equipment to build. Rock was taken from onsite and from a large quarry at the bottom of the curve near the present day toilet facility. A second building was built on the peak concurrently to serve as a toilet. The foundation is still evident at the end of a trail below the overlook to the east.The overlook was restored in the 1990&#39;s by the Southwest Service group of the Sierra Club. They re-tucked the buildings masonry&nbsp; and re-laid and stabilized the patio surrounding the building. The roof was repainted in the interior and brave souls went on the roof to replace shingles blown off in storms.The Forest was in the process of providing recreational areas for the local public to come onto the forest to enjoy the beauty and resources.&nbsp; It was determined that building the overlook would serve several purposes beneficial to the National Forest. The first, being as a recreational overlook from which the Forest could interpret the surrounding areas.&nbsp; Plaques were made and placed within the building for the public to read about the area they were looking at.&nbsp; The second use was as an occasional fire lookout.From the summit of Brian Head Peak, one can look out at Nevada&rsquo;s Wheeler and Highland peaks, Arizona&rsquo;s Mount Trumbull and Navajo Mountain, Beaver County&rsquo;s Tushar Range and the Paunsagunt, Table Cliffs, and Aquarius plateaus.

Waterfalls and rocky streams may be found here as well as reflecting pools. The western section is extremely steep, facing west-northwest towards U.S. Route 7 and Manchester. Four and a half miles of the Appalachian/Long Trail cross the northwest tip of the wilderness. Approximately 80% of the area is forested with northern hardwoods: birch, beech, and maple. Thickets of small spruce dot the area. Remnants of railroad grades and old logging roads remain. Several species of neotropical birds, black bear, moose, deer, pine martin and bobcat inhabit these woods. There are many marshy areas off trail and the ecological balance is quite fragile. Take care and be prepared for muddy trails and an intense black fly season in the spring and early summer.

Navigate the waters and cast a rod in an adventure the whole family can enjoy. The Green River provides spectacular fishing and river-running opportunities, as well as unique geology, outlaw history and Native American rock art.The Green River Float-In campsites contain 17 sites for river goers to float and camp along the mighty Green River. Some of these sites can be reached on foot but most of these sites can only be reached by boat.The campsites are nestled alongside the beautiful Green River in an area typical of a high desert environment. These sites are surrounded by shady juniper, cottonwood and ponderosa pine trees and during the summer various species of wildflowers dot the landscape.Section “A” (Flaming Gorge Dam to Little hole Boat Launch) The A section of the Green River begins just below the Flaming Gorge Dam and proceeds seven miles through a narrow breathtaking canyon to the Little Hole take-out. The towering red canyon cliffs, ponderosa pine, glassy clear water, abundant trout and rapids (class I and II) are what make section \"A\" of the Green River world famous. The Little Hole National Recreation Trail allows foot access to all 7 miles of this stretch of river.Section “B” (Little Hole to Brown’s Park) It’s a little more remote but that means there are a lot fewer people, if that’s the experience you’re looking for. Limited access in this section allows for healthy brown trout populations to thrive. There are 17 river camps in Section B that can be accessed only by hiking or floating in. Remember to reserve your site on the camp registration board at Little Hole or reserve certain sites in advance here on recreation.gov.Section “C” (Browns Park to the Utah/Colorado Border) Section C is the longest of the three sections. It meanders through the high desert valley of Browns Park to the Colorado state line, with wide open features and a lot of flat water. It’s considered the best place to catch a football size trout on a dry fly, but it is also said to be the most challenging for fishing.The Green River offers excellent fishing for rainbow, brown and cutthroat trout. For more information on fishing the Green River, please visit Utah’s Department of Wildlife Resources website .",

These trails lead up to two small lakes, across six peaks above 12,500 feet in elevation, and above numerous small creeks that start in high alpine basins. Along the southern boundary of Vasquez Peak Wilderness the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail offers opportunities for solitude and views.With much of the trail system above timberline, sudden summer thunderstorms can make exposure to lightning in the Vasquez Mountains a dangerous risk.

Moose have been reintroduced successfully to the area and several lakes and streams provide habitat for trout.Never Summer Wilderness offers about 20 miles of trails that lead up gulches and traverse the Continental Divide on two high passes.&nbsp;This area is the scenic backdrop to portions of Trail Ridge Road which travels through Rocky Mountain National Park.Always use&nbsp;Leave No Trace&nbsp;techniques to help keep this area wild, clean, and pristine.&nbsp;",

    "description": "Located on the southern end of the Medicine Bow Mountain Range in north central Colorado, Rawah Wilderness was designated by the Wilderness Act of 1964 and now contains 73,868 acres. &quot;Rawah&quot; is a Native American term meaning &quot;wild place.&quot;Elevations in the Rawah Wilderness range from 8,400 to 13,000 feet. The high peaks were carved by glaciers, resulting in spectacular cirque lakes and moraines. There are twenty-five named lakes, ranging in size from five to 39 acres. This high alpine area contains the headwaters of the McIntyre, Rawah, and Fall Creeks, as well as the Laramie River.The Rawahs are host to mammals such as elk, moose, mule deer, black bear, bighorn sheep, marmot and beaver. There are many species of birds including the red-tailed hawk, white-tailed ptarmigan, golden eagle, raven, Steller&#39;s Jay and a variety of warblers. Lakes and streams are inhabited with lake, cutthroat, rainbow and brown trout. Graylings are also found in this area.The Rawah Wilderness is becoming very popular with summer backpackers, hikers and anglers. It is also popular with hunters in the fall. To encounter the fewest people, plan your trip for mid-week and use less popular trails.Always use&nbsp;Leave No Trace&nbsp;techniques to help keep this area wild, clean, and pristine.&nbsp;",

    "description": "The Hidden Valley Trail is a strenuous hike up a rough trail to a spectacular hanging valley hundreds of feet above the valley floor of Moab, Utah.  It can be turned into a loop with the nearby Moab Rim Trail.  Spectacular views abound!\n\nFrom the parking area, follow the trail up to the base of the Moab Rim and then ascend a series of steep switchbacks. At the top of the switchbacks, the trail heads north and enters Hidden Valley, which is a broad shelf between the top of the Moab Rim and Spanish Valley. Follow the trail to a low rise that separates the two halves of Hidden Valley and continue along through the northern section to a point where the trail swings to the left and goes over a low pass. At the pass, the hiker will be rewarded with a view of the large sandstone fins of the Behind the Rocks area. The trail continues down the west side of the pass for about 1/3 mile where it meets the Moab Rim four-wheel-drive trail. The hike may be extended to the Colorado River by following the Moab Rim four-wheel-drive trail to its starting point. \n\nThere is no fee for hiking the Hidden Valley Trail, however please leave the place nicer than when you arrived by picking up any little you may find and by staying precisely on the trail provided.  This trail sees a lot of multi-trailing and needs some help from you to stay nice!  Thank you!\n\nNote: During the late afternoon, in the summer, this trail is largely in the shade of higher cliffs. Although the Hidden Valley Trail is non-motorized, mountain bikes may sometimes be seen on it.",

Starting her teaching in 1878 in Tybo, Nevada, she returned to Laramie in 1882. Mary married Charles Bellamy in 1886.

    "description": "The United States Congress designated the Dark Canyon Wilderness in 1984 . Great stone arches, old-growth ponderosa pine, aspen groves, meadows, hanging gardens and high country deserts are found at Dark Canyon.  The only designated Wilderness in southeastern Utah, the 47,116-acre Dark Canyon Wilderness is located in a beautiful and remote section of the Colorado Plateau.  Visitors are dwarfed by steep, sculpted and terraced sandstone walls that shade the canyon in morning and late afternoon -- hence the name.  Ancestral Puebloan structures and rock art are tucked among the cliffs.  (Please leave these treasures undisturbed for others to experience.)General Trip Planning Information:One of the biggest concerns with backpacking on the Colorado Plateau, including the Dark Canyon Wilderness is the lack of water.Always treat water by filtering, boiling or chemical treatment before using any water in the backcountry.Below are the general descriptions for water in the Wilderness and the lower canyon. Remember conditions change. This is wild country so always pack enough water to make it several days in case your next water source turns out to be dry.Woodenshoe Canyon:Four miles down the trail you will run into Cherry Canyon coming in from the right (looking down canyon). In the spring there is usually water coming out of Cherry Canyon and running for a mile or more downstream. In the fall it stops running down canyon, but I have never seen the spring in Cherry Canyon dry up completley, although I have seen it running pretty low and muddy. The next water source is approximatley 7 miles downstream (although in the spring it is not unusual to find water in other locations as well) at an area known as Wates Pond. There is a large pothole and spring that usually holds water year round. Approximatley 1 mile below Wates Pond you will come to the Hanging Garden Spring, that flows out of the canyon wall on the right and usually has a pool beneath it.Dark Canyon:If you are coming from the Notch Trailhead, you will usually run into water around the mouth of Drift Trail Canyon. There is also water coming out of the pipe near the Scorup Cabin at the mouth of Horse Pasture Canyon, although this water has a pretty bad taste. In the spring the water often flows from here to the junction with Dark Canyon and then all the way to Rig Canyon and beyond in good water years. In the fall most of this water dries up or gets fouled by livestock and the next possibility for water in Dark Canyon is approximatley 5.5 miles down stream near the junction with Trail Canyon. There are springs in the vicinity that usually run, however we have received reports in the fall of the Trail Canyon Springs being completely dry.

The Ohio River divided freedom and enslavement along several Border States, including Indiana.Located 20 miles north of the Kentucky border, Lick Creek was a mixed community mostly of free African Americans and Quakers. Located in today&rsquo;s Hoosier National Forest, it was an important component of the Underground Railroad. It was originally settled in 1811 by Jonathan Lindley, a white Quaker, and 11 other white and black families from North Carolina.Settlers in the region brought with them an Upland South culture. The origins of this culture can be found mostly in western Virginia, North Carolina, and eastern Mississippi. Developed out of a mixture of European traditions, it mostly belonged to white middle class southerners.By the 1860s, the population of African Americans in the area was over 1,000 and Lick Creek was often referred to as &ldquo;Little Africa.&rdquo; This influx of free African Americans and Quakers, and the influence of the African Methodist Episcopal Church point to involvement with the Underground Railroad.The settlement continued to grow in the mid-nineteenth century. However, after the Civil War African Americans started to leave Lick Creek. Although their departure remains somewhat of a mystery, most probably headed north to industrial jobs. By 1911, there were no longer any African Americans residing in Lick Creek.Sources:Cheryl LaRoche, Free Black Communities and the Underground Railroad: the Geography of Resistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lick Creek Trail: http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/hoosier/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=41572&amp;actid=50This information about the Underground Railroad is part of a geo-located multi-forest interpretive program.

    "description": "African American Landowners of Lick CreekIn the exodus of about 200 Quakers from North Carolina to Indiana in the mid-1800s, a substantial portion of the group were free African Americans. They travelled alongside white Quakers, who although offered a certain degree of protection, did not always provide a welcoming invitation once in Indiana.Despite restricted liberties in Indiana, free Blacks found refuge in the Lick Creek settlement, now part of the Hoosier National Forest. In 1831, Mathew Thomas became one of the first Black land owners in the Lick Creek area. By that time, 96 African Americans lived in the region. Although Thomas was born free, in 1821 his mother indentured him to Zachariah Lindley, a founding settler of the Lick Creek community from North Carolina. Upon completion of his service, Thomas purchased eight acres. Two years later he paid the state&rsquo;s bond of $1,000 to secure his freedom.Other local African Americans followed in Thomas&rsquo;s footsteps. In 1832, recent free Black migrants from North Carolina - Benjamin Roberts, David Dugged, and Peter Lindley - purchased forty acres each of land from the United States government. These homesteads became the center of the Lick Creek settlement.By 1840, 10 African Americans owned land totaling 780 acres in the Lick Creek community. The settlement reached its maximum size in 1855 of over 1,500 acres.The increasing hostility, racial intolerance, and limiting laws imposed by the state supported the need for African Americans to form strong family and communal networks within the settlement. However, after the Civil War African Americans slowly left Lick Creek; by the turn of the twentieth century there were no longer Blacks living in the area.Sources: Cheryl LaRoche, Free Black Communities and the Underground Railroad: The Geography of Resistance.&nbsp;Indiana Historical Bureau, &ldquo;Being Black in Indiana,&rdquo; http://www.in.gov/history/2548.htmUSDA Forest Service, &ldquo;Lick Creek African American Settlement,&rdquo; http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/stelprdb5303625.pdf&nbsp;Lick Creek Trail: http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/hoosier/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=41572&amp;actid=50This information about the Underground Railroad is part of a geo-located multi-forest interpretive program.

    "description": "Iron Furnaces, which converted iron ore to pig iron, dotted the northeastern landscape prior to the 19th century. At the turn of the century, the industry developed in the Hanging Rock Iron Region of Ohio and Kentucky which became the largest iron producer in the US.The Hanging Rock region produced iron from 1818 to 1916 and was one of three in the country capable of producing the iron needed during the Civil War. Not long after the war, the iron boom in Hanging Rock ceased. Hanging Rock&rsquo;s Vesuvius Furnace, located on today&rsquo;s Wayne National Forest, is a remnant of 1 of the 46 furnaces in the region.The iron boom brought in workers who often lived in company towns. Company towns compensated workers with company &ldquo;money&rdquo; that could be used only within the town. Ironmasters owned the furnaces and managed company towns.Ironmasters tended to be abolitionists and often provided support to the Underground Railroad as conductors or station masters. Furnaces and the connecting company towns provided safe havens and financial aid for freedom seekers. Several of the routes used by individuals escaping slavery were along the same paths of Ohio&rsquo;s iron furnaces.Black Fork settlement, an iron company town located in Lawrence County, Ohio, employed mostly African Americans, some escaped slaves. However, Black Fork was not a common iron company town; most only served as stations on the Underground Railroad - like Vesuvius - instead of final destinations.Sources:US Forest Service, &ldquo;Vesuvius Furnace,&rdquo; http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/wayne/specialplaces/?cid=fsm9_006044&ldquo;Iron Furnaces,&rdquo; http://www.oldindustry.org/iron.html&ldquo;Black Fork Settlement, Ohio,&rdquo; http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Black_Fork_Settlement,_Ohio&ldquo;Historic Iron Furnaces,&rdquo; http://www.ohio.org/destination/appalachia/historic-iron-furnacesUnderground Railroad and Freedom Trails on National Forests, http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/wayne/learning/history-culture/?cid=fsm9_006142This information about the Underground Railroad is part of a geo-located multi-forest interpretive program.

    "description": "The Underground Railroad consisted of a large secret network of travel routes and safe havens for freedom-seekers escaping slavery in the mid-19th century. The Ohio River divided freedom and enslavement along several Border States, including Ohio.Like most states achieving statehood after Congress issued the Northwest Ordinance in 1787 &ndash; which forbid slavery in states entering the union north of the Ohio River &ndash; Ohio&rsquo;s population was split between pro-slavery and anti-slavery sentiments. However, its location along the Ohio River meant that there were great opportunities to support the Underground Railroad. By the 1830s, Ohio became a hotbed for Underground Railroad activities. While many freedom seekers passed through Ohio at various entry points, others settled into the state.Archaeologists and volunteers at the Wayne National Forest, in collaboration with the Friends of Freedom Society, the Multicultural Genealogical Center, and several historically Black Colleges, have focused research on two 19th century African-American settlements. These settlements, Paynes Crossing and Poke Patch, existed primarily from the 1820s to the 1880s. The small homesteads consisted of free Blacks, Whites, and Native Americans. Because of the settlements&rsquo; prime locations, both towns most likely served as stations on the Underground Railroad. Only a church and two cemeteries remain today.___Paynes Crossing&nbsp;In the mid-19th century, routes toward freedom for escaped slaves went in several directions on the Underground Railroad. Freedom seekers relied on forests, rivers, and other landscape features for natural paths. Often freedom seekers headed north from slave states through the free state of Ohio. In Ohio, freedom seekers were likely to have come across the free Black community of Paynes Crossing, located in today&rsquo;s Wayne National Forest.Paynes Crossing was near New Straitsville, Ohio where farming and the iron industry dominated the landscape. It was a small community established in the 1830s by free Black migrants from Virginia. By the 1850s, African American families owned most of the land.Research indicates that Paynes Crossing was a logical stop along the Underground Railroad and that the community&rsquo;s residents were active in aiding freedom seekers. Today, only a cemetery remains as a physical clue about the stories of Paynes Crossing.Sources:&ldquo;Underground Railroad in Ohio,&rdquo; http://touringohio.com/history/ohio-underground-railroad.htmlUSDA, US Forest Service, &ldquo;Underground Railroad and Freedom Trails on the National Forests,&rdquo; http://www.fs.usda.gov/detailfull/wayne/about-forest/?cid=fsm9_006142&amp;width=full&ldquo;The Underground Railroad on the Wayne National Forest&rdquo; 2014 Brochure, Forest Supervisor&rsquo;s Office &amp; Athens Ranger District.For more information on the Payne Cemetery, please visit: http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/wayne/specialplaces/?cid=fsm9_006031This information about the Underground Railroad is part of a geo-located multi-forest interpretive program.

    "description": "The Lick Creek settlement in today&rsquo;s Hoosier National Forest was an active free Black community in southern Indiana in the mid-1800s. Along with other African Americans in Indiana, Lick Creek offered up some of their own to fight in the Civil War.Simon Locust, an African American, served one year with Company E 13th Infantry Regiment of the United States Colored Troops (USCT). Locust was drafted into USCT in 1864 along with about 1,500 African Americans in Indiana. Locust returned to the Lick Creek area after the war and was the only veteran listed as living in Orange County. He died in 1891 and was also the last person to be buried in the local church&rsquo;s cemetery, the only remnant of Lick Creek left today.Unlike Locust, Martin Scott was of mixed heritage and passed as white in order to fight with white troops in Company I 19th Indiana Infantry Division in 1864. Confederate soldiers captured Scott and held him captive after he was wounded in the left thigh at the Battle of the Wilderness. Private Scott was imprisoned at Andersonville, Georgia until July 1865. Scott took a risk pretending to be a white man; however, if the Confederates had found out he was part black he would have been killed upon capture.Recently freed Solomon and Margaret Newby arrived at the Lick Creek settlement in 1840 from North Carolina. The first of their three children, James Harling Newby, was born free in Indiana in 1843. The Newby family left Lick Creek and migrated to North Buxton, Canada. In 1863 at age 20, Newby felt compelled to fight in the Civil War and left Canada to go to Philadelphia where he enlisted in Company I, 3rd Regiment Infantry, USCT.Cheryl LaRoche, Free Black Communities and the Underground Railroad: the Geography of Resistance&nbsp;National Forest Service, &ldquo;Lick Creek African American Settlement&rdquo;, http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/hoosier/learning/history-culture/?cid=fsbdev3_01749519th Indiana Brigade, &ldquo;Martin Scott,&rdquo; http://www.19thindianaironbrigade.com/Scott,_Martin.html&nbsp;Lick Creek Trail: http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/hoosier/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=41572&amp;actid=50This information about the Underground Railroad is part of a geo-located multi-forest interpretive program.

    "description": "The African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) grew out of the Free African Society that was founded in 1787. Discouraged and upset by blatant racial discrimination against free African Americans within the American Methodist church, members created an African Congregation. Although some wanted to affiliate with Protestant Episcopal, Richard Allen &ndash; a founder of the Free African Society &ndash; led a small group who were committed to remaining Methodists.In order to assert religious autonomy, Allen sued for the rights of his congregation in 1807 and 1815 to prevent White members from interfering with his congregation.Prior to the Civil War, AME was located mainly in the Northeast and Midwest, although churches did appear in some slave states. For instance, Bishop William Paul Quinn helped establish churches along the Ohio River in both free and slave states.The AME churches, especially the Bethel Congregation in Pennsylvania, were known for aiding fugitive slaves on their journey to freedom as part of the Underground Railroad. Although there is no clear record, it seems likely that Quinn&rsquo;s anti-slavery work and the AME churches he helped establish along the Ohio River played a role in those quests for freedom. AME churches in Indiana near today&rsquo;s Hoosier National Forest most likely participated by providing shelter and aid to fugitives; community members also may have served as Underground Railroad &ldquo;conductors.&rdquo;The AME church served as the focal point of the Lick Creek settlement. In 1843, early Lick Creek pioneers Thomas and Matilda Roberts sold an acre of their land to five trustees to establish the church. The trustees were Elias Roberts, Mathew Thomas, Thomas Roberts, Isaac Scott, and Samuel Chandler. The deed stated that the trustees needed to build a place for worship for members of the AME. Lick Creek&rsquo;s AME church operated until 1869.The AME church was built near the settlement&rsquo;s Black Methodist Union Meeting House on land owned by resident Ishmael Roberts. Although it is unclear when, the Methodist House was eventually abandoned and likely replaced by another AME church.Sources:National Forest Service, &ldquo;Lick Creek African American Settlement&rdquo;, http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/hoosier/learning/history-culture/?cid=fsbdev3_017495National Park Services, &ldquo;Aboard the Underground Railroad,&rdquo; https://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/underground/pa3.htmAmerican Methodist Episcopal Church, &ldquo;Our History,&rdquo; http://ame-church.com/our-church/our-history/&nbsp;Lick Creek Trail: http://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/hoosier/recreation/hiking/recarea/?recid=41572&amp;actid=50This information about the Underground Railroad is part of a geo-located multi-forest interpretive program.

The goal is to protect the existing outstanding and remarkable values and preserve a free-flowing condition for present and future generations. This designation applies to the following three sections:7 miles from below Kinzua Dam to Route 6 bridge in Warren48 miles from Buckaloons Campground to Alcorn Island (by Oil City), and32 miles from south of Franklin to Emlenton.The corridor boundary runs along the plateau ridge on both sides and has extensive areas of privately owned lands with many homes and seasonal recreational residences along the shoreline. Public access is good generally from both sides and few hazards make this an ideal river for novice and family canoeing. Oak forests predominate along steep side slopes and there is wooded-riverine habitat in some of the floodplains.  It contains the seven Allegheny Wilderness Islands often used by boaters for dispersed camping and fishing.The Allegheny Islands Wilderness contains seven islands stretched between Buckaloons and Tionesta along the Allegheny Wild and Scenic River. The islands are popular for dispersed camping, exploration, and viewing scenery and wildlife. They are mostly vegetated with fine riverine forests of sycamore, silver maple, shagbark hickory, and green ash. Dense grasses and other thick vegetation make access limited. There are no developed trails or other facilities on the islands. The Allegheny River is one of the primary tributaries to the Ohio River.  It joins with the Monongahela River to form the Ohio River at the \"Point\" in Pittsburgh, PA.  The Allegheny starts in Pennsylvania, near Cobb Hill, meanders into New York into Cattaraugus County, near Salamanca, before heading back into Pennsylvania northeast of Warren.The course of the river forms much of the northwestern boundary of the Allegheny National Forest before reaching Franklin where the river turns southeast.  Within the borders of the Allegheny National Forest the river is fed by Kinzua Creek, Conewango Creek, Brokenstraw Creek, Tionesta Creek, Oil Creek and French Creek.  The Clarion River joins the Allegheny near Kittanning.",

Billions of years ago, this area was covered by an ocean. Layers of sediment were deposited on the ocean floor, eventually hardening to form limestone and other sedimentary rock layers.Underground molten rock called magma pushed the sedimentary layers upward forming hills. During the uplifting, crevasses within the limestone hills filled with magma. These flows of magma, called intrusions, cooled to form igneous rock.The limestone and other sedimentary rock erodes at a faster rate than the harder igneous rock. As the oceans receded, the overlying sedimentary rock eroded, exposing the igneous intrusions. Crow Peak and other peaks you can see from Crow Peak summit, such as Bear Butte, Spearfish Mountain, and Terry Peak, were formed in this manner. Erosion of the igneous rock and the sedimentary rock surrounding these peaks continues to shape the landscape of the Northern Black Hills.",

    "description": "Journey through early American history and walk in the footsteps of our nation’s founding fathers as you explore the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route (WRRRNHT). This National Historic Trail commemorates over 680 miles of land and water trails followed by the allied armies of General George Washington and the French Lieutenant General Comte Jean de Rochambeau. During their 1781 march from Newport, Rhode Island to Yorktown, Virginia, the French army established an encampment on what is now the Meadowood Special Recreation Management Area (SRMA). A segment of this trail connects with a BLM system of trails crossing the SRMA on the historic Mason Neck Peninsula, just a short drive from the nation’s capital.  The WRRRNHT follows the historical route taken by George Washington and French General Rochambeau during the Revolutionary War.  The course of the American Revolution unfolds along this 700-mile trail across ten states. General George Washington and French General Rochambeau led their combined forces on this path to the siege of Yorktown. The effort and cooperation between the two sides secured American independence. Over 250 years ago, Meadowood was an encampment site used by portions of General Rochambeau’s army during the march to and from Yorktown. This area was used by the baggage train and a detachment of Hussars (light cavalry) on the march to Yorktown in September of 1781. Five different detachments of Rochambeau’s army used Meadowood during the army’s return march in July 1782. In 2012, archaeological investigations identified the location of the site when musket repair tools, bayonet fragments, and iron kettle pieces indicative of a military encampment were found. Additional archaeological research is under development to better understand the precise structure and layout of the encampment. At Meadowood, the trail transects open meadows, enters mature hardwood forests, and crosses riparian wetlands. Visitors can hike this 1.6-mile historic trail and be on the lookout for interpretive signage.   While in the area, visit Gunston Hall, the home of Founding Father George Mason, a strong supporter of individual liberties and the author of the Virginia Declaration of Rights. Many of the concepts in that document found embodiment in the first ten amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights.",

The sandy ground is soft and your feet sink down in the thick ooze, leaving a clear footprint with every step you take.  The Red Gulch Dinosaur Tracksite is the largest tracksite in Wyoming and one of only a few worldwide from the Middle Jurassic Period (160 million to 180 million years old). Until the tracks were reported in 1997, most scientists thought the entire Bighorn Basin and most of Wyoming was covered by an ancient ocean called the Sundance Sea.  Not only are there hundreds of tracks at the site, but the 40-acre area could contain thousands more. The dinosaur tracks were clearly made just at the shoreline, not in deep ocean water, and there must have been large areas of dry land to support not only dinosaurs but other animals and plants.  The limy mud that the dinosaurs were walking in probably felt similar to cement just starting to harden. The tracks were perfectly preserved when the mud hardened and was covered by more layers of ooze, and then by fine sand, filling the tracks and preserving their shape. Over the years, layer upon layer of sediment filled in over the top. Much later, erosion went to work and removed those layers, exposing the tracks that had been made all those millions of years ago.  The tracks were reported in 1997 by Greybull native Erik Kvale while enjoying the scenery with Allen Archer, Rowena Manuel, Cliff Manuel and Fran Paton on BLM-administered lands. Their discovery altered the  views about the Sundance Formation and the paleoenvironment of the Middle Jurassic Period in North America.  In 2002, the site was renovated with a new boardwalk, interpretive signs, picnic tables, benches, trails, an upgraded access road and graveled parking for up to 15 cars and three buses.",

    "description": "Overview:Jordan Craters is a volcanic field, covering 27 square miles with olivine basalt. This otherworldly scene is the result of lava flow that occurred in two main phases, both less than 30,000 years ago. This ancient lava field features craters, lava tubes and pahoehoe (a Hawaiian term meaning \"ropy,\" describing the smooth, billowy lava flows), showing just how mobile a lava flow can be. Drive right up to Coffee Pot Crater, a well-preserved, steep-sided crater that covers two-thirds of a square mile. Hike through or take photos of this alien-like terrain and explore the area's beautiful and geologically violent past. Know Before You Go:The area is full of rugged terrain; footing is precarious.\nLack of trails, sharp lava formations and open pits can be dangerous for the most experienced hiker.\nThe lava fields can reach temperatures of more than 120 degrees during the summer. Dehydration is a very real and very dangerous possibility. Bring enough water to remain hydrated.\nRoads become nearly impassable when wet.\nWinter weather can make access difficult.\nHigh-clearance, four-wheel-drive vehicles are recommended. Point of Interest:Coffee Pot Crater:  the only crater on site to offer vehicle access. This area also features roughly aligned spatter cones - blocks of lava that have welded together, forming cones.",

The lakes have since been deepened by homesteaders and farmers. Today, most of the water in Halverson Lakes comes from irrigation run-off from the upland plateau. Decades ago the lakes were stocked with fish - blue gill, bass, and crappie - which are the primary catch today. Cliffs and sloping bluffs of basalt separate the shoreline and canyon bottom from the upland desert. Basaltic boulders, deposited by the flooding waters of Lake Bonneville 15,000 years ago, lie like giant-size melons on the sandy bar.

The total mileage for the system is now 61 miles. The new trails, which are almost all singletrack, have added variety and stunning views to the mountain biking experience.  All of the trails can be ridden in either direction, however some of the trails are more fun to ride downhill. There are maps and signs at every junction in the system. Riders should bring their own maps for navigation. Maps are available as printouts off of this site or for purchase on waterproof paper at all local bike shops. This trail system is a popular shuttle system with riders utilizing local shuttle companies or orchestrating their own shuttle. These shuttled rides often end in Moab by utilizing the Moab Canyon paved bike path which starts at the junction of Highways 313 and 191. Some riders also park at trail junctions in the middle of the system and knit together loops around their vehicles. Another option for expert and very fit riders is to connect the Gold Bar Singletrack Trail to the Portal Trail or the Poison Spider Jeep Trail and on to Moab. This ride is very tough and should be reserved for the hardy few who want an extreme challenge.",

For wildlife watchers, numerous waterfowl, raptors, deer, antelope, and elk abound. If you re an ATV rider, you ll want to try the Paiute ATV trail, which can be accessed from here. The primary activities are fishing and boating although it also serves as a regional staging site for extended and day trips into the surrounding National Forest, Utah State Lands and BLM managed lands by horse, foot, and vehicle. The Richfield Field Office manages day use facilities, dispersed and primitive camping facilities, and fishing access to the Reservoir at Fisherman's Beach, Tamarisk Point, and South Point along the west side of the reservoir. There is no potable water but picnic tables and pit toilets are available. Otter Creek Reservoir is located at the southeastern corner of Paiute County near the town of Antimony. A Utah State Park is located at the south end and provides well developed facilities, while the Richfield BLM maintains several semi-primitive sites along the west side of the lake and dispersed use is available on the east side of the reservoir. The main attraction is fishing and camping. The lands are sagebrush steppe. The Parker Mountains are located to the east, Monroe Mountain and Kingston canyon to the west of the lake, and the Sevier Plateau is to the southwest. For current weather conditions, contact Otter Creek State Park (435) 624-3268.",

While no copper was actually successfully smelted due to the low quality of the ore, the tale of the site is interesting in itself.  Features at the site include a 75’ foot pile of logs used to fire the smelter, mining cabins, mine tunnels, and a water cistern.  Just before the site is a grave marker of a sheep header who was murdered by members of the robbers roost gang.   Visitors to the site enjoy exploring and photographing the mining site and structures and hiking the number of trails which wind though the area. The site is located in a remote part of the San Rafael desert over a rough and dusty road. Remember to bring enough water and supplies for your time at the site. While the large pile of lumber may tempt you, please do not collect any of the wood for any reason, including for fires, as the pile is an important feature of the site.",

    "name": "Desolation Gray Canyons of the Green River",
    "description": "OverviewThe Green River enters Desolation Canyon just north of Sand Wash as it exits the Uinta Basin. Canyon walls are stream and lake deposits of the Eocene age then transition into the Cretaceous delta and sea deposits of Gray Canyon. Along the river, the riparian zone holds willow, cottonwood, box elder and other woody riparian species and provides critical habitat to neo-tropical migrant birds, nesting waterfowl, and wintering deer and elk. Moving away from the cool shade of the riparian zone, one immediately enters a desert environment dominated by salt shrubs and bunch grasses. There is a small sagebrush zone that gives way to pinyon and juniper slopes. The view is always dominated by rock and cliff. Douglas fir finds a home in protected, well watered alcoves. Over sixty riffles and rapids punctuate the trip. None are particularly difficult - a dozen or so can cause some trouble for the unprepared traveler. Camping tends to be idyllic on a clean sandy beach in front of a grove of cottonwood trees which offer shade and a windbreak. More than 60 side canyons descend from the plateau to meet the Green River. Every side canyon holds a surprise. In a few, a cold, clear stream pours into a warm silty river. Prehistoric rock art is prolific along with the ruins of dwellings, towers and granaries. Between Sand Wash and Nefertiti Rapid, users set their own itinerary. There are a number of hiking trails in the canyon. Of the 84 mile long river segment, 66 miles are within the Desolation Canyon Wilderness Study Area - the largest in the lower 48 states.  The Desolation Canyon National Historic Landmark (NHL) extends one mile on either side of the river from Nine Mile Creek to Florence Creek. The NHL was designated by the Secretary of the Interior in 1969 as part of the centennial celebration of the 1869 exploration of the Green and Colorado Rivers by John Wesley Powell.  There is a primitive boat ramp at Sand Wash, a primitive eight-site campground, a contact/information station, staffed ranger station and toilets. Trash receptacles and water are not provided. With the remoteness of the area groups can camp the night before at Sand Wash. Due to frequent mosquito plagues, Sand Wash offers four campsites with screened cabins. Contact the Bureau of Land Managements (BLM) Price Field Office for cabin reservations at (435) 636-3600. This contrasts with the more developed Swaseys Boat Ramp where there is a large concrete boat ramp along with improved parking, toilets and trash removal services.",

Many of the trails are a dirt surface with sections of rolling slickrock humps similar to the Sovereign Trail (although generally easier). The total mileage for the system is 24 miles. This includes the Zephyr Trail, which connects the Klonzo and Moab Brands mountain biking areas (.8 mile on singletrack and 3.2 miles on a road).   All of the trails are intermediate with small tougher sections and have proven to be fast and fun with moderate climbs that can usually be completed in the saddle. In general, the trails are more fun running counter clockwise and are signed as such. Many different loops can be knit together on this system allowing for riders to return again and again and have a different ride each time.  There are two trailheads (A and B). Both are about 2.5 miles out on the Willow Springs Road, which is about 10 miles north of the Colorado River Bridge on Highway 191. Generally the Willow Springs Road is 2 wheel-drive, however it crosses Courthouse Wash which often requires 4 wheel-drive and occasionally requires high clearance as well. Riders who don t want to risk the dry wash crossing can park before the wash and ride the extra 1.5 miles to the trailheads. There are maps and signs at every junction in the system.

Ten of thousands of visitors hike this first 0.6-mile section of trail each spring when snowmelt from the Pine Valley Mountains creates short cascades of water that pools in slickrock bowls of the beautiful red Navajo Sandstone.\n\tTo continue beyond this popular destination, hikers must use a series of small toe holds carved into the sandstone to ascend this first obstacle. After 0.4 miles the route will leave the Quail Creek drainage and enter a side canyon on the left.&nbsp;\n\n\nFrom the Cottonwood Trailhead\n\n\n\tHikers will begin on the Cottonwood Canyon trail (0.3 miles) from there the trail will fan out into five different trails. The Red Reef trail is sandwiched between the Cottonwood Canyons and Prospector trails. Be sure to follow early trail markers to make sure you are on the correct route. The Red Reef Trail will then enter the Cottonwood Canyon Wilderness and follow along a tributary of Cottonwood Creek.&nbsp;\n\n\nPoint to point\n\n\n\tThe full route (5.74 miles) includes difficult sections with steep and rugged terrain where hikers will need to use their hands to navigate steep chimneys and various obstacles. Technical climbing gear is not required, but some hikers may use ropes for additional safety. Be prepared for class 2 to class 3 hiking. A good pair of hiking shoes with traction is highly recommended. Within designated Wilderness areas, the route is not signed and may require route finding.&nbsp;\n\n\nParking\n\n\n\tDay-use parking in the Red Cliffs Recreation Area is extremely limited and will fill to maximum capacity on weekends, holidays, and most days during the spring and fall months.\n\tTo avoid being turned away, be sure to arrive early in the morning to find a designated parking space. Parking on vegetation or along the road is prohibited.\n\tPlease be respectful of other visitors by not parking in, or walking through, reserved campsites. If all designated day-use parking is full, visitors may use the White Reef Trailhead as an overflow lot.&nbsp;\n\n\nRestrooms\n\n\n\tVault toilets are located near campsite seven in the Red Cliffs Campground, and at the Cottonwood and White Reef trailheads.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\nPets\n\n\n\tPets are permitted but must be kept on a leash outside of the Wilderness boundaries. Pet waste disposal bags are provided at each of the trailheads. Be responsible and carry waste bags with you until they can be deposited into a trash receptacle. Never leave them on the side of the trail.\n\n\nSafety\n\n\n\tQuail Creek has a high potential for flash flooding. Flash floods are a sudden increase in the depth and speed of water in rivers or streams due to heavy rain from thunderstorms. Always check the weather forecast and flash flood potential before entering a narrow canyon.\n\tLeave an itinerary with someone and check in when you are done.\n\tThe depth of the water in pools can vary, especially after flood events. Never jump into a pool without first verifying depth. Severe ankle and knee injuries have occurred.\n\tThe desert is an extreme environment. Carry enough water, one gallon per person per day, and drink it.\n\tCell phone reception is extremely limited.&nbsp;\n\n\nLeave No Trace\n\n\n\tKeep food away from all wildlife, and never approach or touch a wild animal.\n\tProtect the canyon walls, rocks, and trees from graffiti and vandalism.\n\tStay on established trails to protect vegetation and fragile biological soils.\n\tProtect the natural sounds of the canyon by talking softly and using headphones for music.\n\tDrones are not permitted within the National Conservation Area or within any designated Wilderness areas.&nbsp;",

Although several of the obstacles (such as Widowmaker) can be legally bypassed, there is no way around  Mirror Gulch , a narrow pass through solid rock. The route travels up to Arth's Rim overlooking Hwy 191.  The trail has been marked by the Red Rock Four Wheelers Jeep Club, but markings can fade and/or disappear. It is advisable to carry an excellent map and/or guidebook for this route.  Three miles after turning off onto the Metal Masher trail, there is a confusing area of slickrock. Watch for the paint on the rocks. About one and one half miles further on, you come to the narrow and ledgy Mirror Gulch. After climbing Mirror Gulch, you will ascend to the rim overlooking U.S. 191. The route continues along the rim for about a mile, turning to make its descent back to the Gemini Bridges road near  The Widowmaker . This very challenging obstacle can be bypassed by a road to its south. The return trip is less challenging, although you are rewarded with lovely views. \n\nYou will rejoin the Gemini Bridges route three miles east of Utah Highway 313. Turn west onto the main Gemini Bridges Road and follow this easy county road up to the paved highway. From there, you can either go north back to Moab or chose to tour Canyonlands National Park or Dead Horse Point State Park to the south",

    "description": "Chamberlain’s Ranch Trailhead (also called North Fork Trailhead) provides the primary access to the North Fork Virgin River Wilderness Study Area and is the starting point for top-down hikes into The Narrows in Zion National Park. The 16-mile hike to the Temple of Sinawava Trailhead in Zion National Park is generally done in two days, as cold water and rounded, submerged river rocks make for challenging footing. Groups hiking into the park must obtain a Zion Wilderness Permit and adhere to the National Park’s rules and regulations. The route into The Narrows from Chamberlain’s Ranch Trailhead is undeveloped, with no designated trails or amenities after leaving the trailhead. The route generally follows the river, although it is possible to follow BLM93 as it parallels the river for the first 3 miles or so. Roughly 3.5 miles from the trailhead, the route enters the North Fork Virgin River Wilderness Study Area and the sandstone walls of the canyon become increasingly narrow and dramatic. The river passes through the Deep Creek Wilderness and two sections of private land before entering Zion National Park for the remainder of the route. Please do your part to protect the North Fork of the Virgin River and The Narrows by following Leave No Trace principles:Plan ahead and prepare to ensure that you have detailed route information as well as proper skills, equipment, and permits. Bring all the supplies you’ll need, including a way to purify water. Be self-sufficient and don’t expect others to rescue you in an emergency.Dispose of waste properly and packing out what you pack in. Protect soils and vegetation by traveling and camping on durable surfaces.Leave what you find, and leave the canyon in a natural state; don’t mark rock faces with graffiti or muddy handprints, build rock cairns, or disturb vegetation.Minimize campfire impacts – fires are not allowed anywhere in the Zion Wilderness.Respect wildlife by maintaining your distance and not harassing or feeding wild animals.Be considerate of other visitors by respecting their experience and keeping noise down.Know before you go: The Zion National Park website and visitor centers offer additional trip-planning resources and information about wilderness permits, rules, and regulations.Amenities at the trailhead are limited to a vault toilet, informational signs, and a parking area. Overnight camping is not allowed at the Chamberlain’s Ranch Trailhead.Portions of the hiking route cross private land; be respectful of private landowners.Narrow canyons are extremely flood prone and passage through them should not be attempted if there is a risk of rain or flash flooding. Zion National Park does not issue permits when the river’s flow is 120 cubic feet per second (cfs) or greater. However, the BLM does not restrict visitation to the BLM-managed portion due to weather concerns or flood risk; individuals are responsible for deciding whether to enter the canyon.Attempting to access Chamberlain’s Ranch Trailhead by passenger car is not recommended. The unpaved portion of North Fork Road is clay based and quickly becomes impassable to even 4-wheel-drive vehicles when wet. Snow closes the road in the winter.",

This trail is rated difficult for its length (remember to add 1.8 miles if starting from Hurricane Hills Trailhead), exposure to steep drop-offs, narrow widths, and steep grades. Only hikers are allowed on the trail as a mix of users is incompatible due to the previously mentions issues. A perfect example of the rugged nature of the trail is “The Drop”, a steep narrow passage with large lava rocks and boulders lining the way.  Beginning at .3 miles (from the Hurricane Hills Trailhead) the trail “drops” steeply from the mesa top to the bench where a historical water canal was constructed. It continues to wind across a steep side slope, pressing against the cliff face, and leaving only a narrow pathway.Twelve tunnels were originally built along the canal through solid rock. Three are included in this trail, but one is closed for safety. You can walk through two of the tunnels, but be sure to bring a flashlight, as the longest is about 40 feet long and pitch black in the center on even the brightest of days. There are also tunnel ‘bypasses’ for those who aren’t so keen on confined spaces. You will also come across a short bridge made of planks of wood, and a couple of names etched in stone dating from the 1980s. There are several interpretive panels along the way to enlighten you on the trails past. The history of the canal is fascinating. Diverting water from the Virgin River, 7 miles away, was first envisioned by two men in 1893: James Jepson and John Steele, but it was accomplished through the motivation of entire communities. What we see today is the achievement of what seemed like an impossible task, accomplished mainly by determined citizens of neighboring communities. The residents were farmers dealing with flooding, and desperately needed more cultivable land. They spent their summers farming and their winters working on the canal with just hand-powered tools. By 1902 only eight to ten men were left working on the canal.  After an influx of money from the Salt Lake City LDS church, the canal was completed two years later, and water flowed onto the Hurricane Bench on August 6,1904, generating 2,000 acres of fertile land. NOTE: There has been recent rockfall on some sections of the trail (2011); some scrambling is required; use caution.",

    "description": "Fantasy Canyon is an area composed of unique erosional features located about 27 miles south of Vernal, in northeastern Utah. Even though the area is only about 10 acres in size, it contains some of the most unique geologic features in the world. The site was officially documented by early explorer and paleontologist Earl Douglass, who recorded the area by other names such as “The Devil’s Playground” and “Hades Pit.” He published photographs of this area in a 1909 publication called “The Columbian Magazine.” Fantasy Canyon teapot formationGeology: The rocks of Fantasy Canyon were deposited during the Eocene Epoch. The age of the rocks date around 38 to 50 million years ago. During the geologic period, the Uinta Basin was occupied by a large lake called Lake Uinta. The lake extended 120 miles west to Heber City, 30 miles east to Rangely, south to the Book Cliff Divide, north to the Unita Mountains, and was about a half mile deep. Fantasy Canyon is along the east shore of what was once Lake Uinta, where the sediments eroded from the surrounding high lands. Sediments were deposited and the once loose sands, silts, and clays were forged into sandstone and shale. Because of different rates of weathering, the more durable sandstone remained while the more easily weathered siltstone and shale washed away, yielding this spectacular scenery. Today’s geologic formations of Fantasy Canyon will eventually give way to weather and then topple and erode into sand, but new formations will appear as the topsoil washes away. Because the delicate formations are so fragile the area is referred to as “Nature’s China Shop.” Mineralization: There are black ribbons of coal-like material along the small washes on the trail or as horizontal stripes in the rocks. This magnetic material is called magnetite (iron oxide). It is the only mineral which shows strong magnetism. Magnetite was named for Magnes, a Greek shepherd, who discovered the mineral on Mount Ida, Australia. He noted the nails of his shoes and the iron ferrule of his staff clung to a rock. There are inch-wide black vertical northwest – southeast running veins in the formations. This material is called \"Gilsonite\" (hydrocarbon), named after U.S. Marshall Samuel H. Gilson. Gilsonite was discovered in the early 1860’s, but it was not until the mid-1880’s that Gilson began to promote the mineral as a waterproof coating for wooden pilings, as an insulation for wire cable, and as a unique varnish. Fossils: The Uinta formation is an important keeper of a portion of the fossil record for this area. It contains the widely scattered bones of creatures, mostly mammals, which roamed the Basin during the Eocene. Fossilized turtle shells are visible in the area.",

The trail shares its parking and beginning segment with the hiking and equestrian communities.  From there, the equestrians follow an old wagon road and then traverses a plateau to a slick rock overlook of the picturesque Ashley Creek. The equestrian trail has an intermediate hill climb which is fairly steep up the old wagon road and has some technical rock for your horse to get through.   The hikers head north up the slick rock where the views of Vernal are stunning. The hiking trail is approximately 1.5 miles in length and is suitable for intermediate hikers. The hike is best done in the spring/summer/fall, but please avoid the trail system when it is wet to prevent damage.  Anticipate a rapid change in elevation and rest frequently if you need to!

The Big Juniper Tree is nationally ranked as the second largest alligator juniper tree in the United States (American Forests 1980, “National Register of Big Trees.” American Forestry Association, Washington, D.C.). The tree diameter is 70.2 inches. Its circumference is 18 feet 4 inches; its crown spread is 62 feet wide; and its height is 63 feet. The trail length and gentle nature of the route leading to the Big Tree make it a pleasing choice. The route follows primitive roads that pass through the rolling foothills of the Pinos Altos Mountains. Key vista points along the trail provide impressive views of the Twin Sisters and the Kneeling Nun.During the 1960’s, Fort Bayard was an active military post housing soldiers (including Buffalo Soldiers) who provided protection to the local mining settlements of Pinos Altos and Santa Rita. The route to the Big Juniper Tree is an old wagon road that provided access to the Pinos Altos Mountains. Rough cut lumber and fuel wood were transported down to the fort via these roads and hauled on horse and mule powered wagons.Current management of the Fort Bayard area emphasize wildlife, watershed protection and recreational activities. Trail users often see glimpses of wildlife including the resident elk herd that frequent the Fort Bayard area.",

With Cretaceous Age upland bluffs of Eagle sandstone, minor badlands, steep drainages, weathered shale, and scattered ponderosa pine, this 3,800-acre parcel of land allows for many wildlife-viewing opportunities. Open to camping, hiking, horseback riding, mountain biking, and hunting (during season), Acton provides multiple possibilities for use year-round. About 6.6 miles of mapped roads are open for motorized use.\n\nThe Acton Recreation Area is located within the Hoskins Basin Archaeological District, an area containing the remains of both conical and cribbed aboriginal wooden dwellings. Both types are increasing rarities on the northwest plains, as are sites where both sorts of structures are represented. Reports of early explorers indicated that dwellings of this type were once common. Due to loss through natural causes (weathering, floods, and fire), many of the structures have been lost. Their use for firewood and fence posts accounts for other losses.\n\nDistribution of the both the cribbed and conical dwellings is quite limited. The cribbed type is reported to have been spotted only from south-central Montana to northern Wyoming. The conical type has a wider range but is not as common in south-central Montana as the cribbed type. No off-road motorized vehicle use is permitted to protect the archaeological sites and wildlife habitat.",

The area features a trail network for a variety of recreational uses such as hiking, bicycling, equestrian, and wildlife viewing. Some of the natural interests around the areas include:The Big Cottonwood Tree (west of the house), which is not as old as you might think. Cottonwoods grow very quickly in favorable conditions. This one is estimated to be between 90 and 130 years old, whereas the cottonwood behind the house was planted in 1956.Abandoned agricultural fields dominate the landscape here and were once used for growing alfalfa and other feed for cattle. Native vegetation is steadily returning as can be seen along the Del Valle Trail.The riparian forest, one of the rarest forest types in the world, stands in stark contrast to the adjacent fields. The cottonwood and willow trees provide essential habitat for a variety of wildlife, including over 350 species of birds. The trees and other riparian vegetation also promote soil deposition, which over time, will refill the incised channel.Linear pools, which often form along rivers, provide excellent habitat for turtles, frogs and fish. They are created by a wash coming into the river, thick vegetative growth or changes in underground geology. Kingfisher Pond was created years ago when this area was a sand and gravel quarry. The large hole created by the operation eventually filled up with ground and flood water. There are no surface inlets or outlets. Green kingfishers are often spotted here!",

    "description": "This site marks part of the historic Dominguez-Escalante expedition. Fathers Francisco Dominguez and Silvestre Escalante, Spanish priests, may have been the first Europeans to see the Arizona Strip on their expedition in 1776. They camped here, at the San Bartoleme Camp, in October 1776. On foot, they traveled from Santa Fe, New Mexico through western Colorado, to Spanish Fork, Utah, and then down through northern Arizona back to Santa Fe. Others crossed the Strip along the Old Spanish Trail during the 1830's and 1840's.\n\nOpened as a trade route between Santa Fe and Los Angeles, the Spanish Trail became a major link connecting New Mexico and southern California from 1829 to 1848. It consisted of a 1,120-mile northward-looping course traversing six states — New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada, and California. Hostile Indian tribes — Apache, Navajo, and Mojave — prevented the opening of a direct route between Santa Fe and Los Angeles.\n\nMining activities, timber cutting and settlement by farmers and ranchers began by the 1870's. Settlements founded by these pioneers lasted long enough for a post office and general store to be built at Wolfhole, and one-room schoolhouses at Little Tanks and Mount Trumbull. In the days of horse-drawn wagons, trips to town (St. George, Utah) from these communities took more than one day each way. Travelers would store feed for their stock on flat-topped boulders along the route. Later, the Civilian Conservation Corps created or improved many of the access roads and other structures. As the availability and use of motorized vehicles increased, populations of the little settlements dwindled. The communities of Mt. Trumbull, Wolf Hole and Little Tanks are now ghost towns.\n\nTraveling across the Arizona Strip today, it is not so difficult to imagine the earlier times and modes of transportation: horse, wagon and Model T. Place names like Poverty Mountain, Hungry Valley, Last Chance Spring, Death Valley and Tombstone Canyon still attest to the rough life of the pioneers.",

It is designated a BLM Watchable Wildlife road, and is enjoyed by a variety of users – including outdoor enthusiasts, birders, ranchers, upland bird and big game hunters, rafters, and campers. Cattle graze on the open range here, too, so be prepared for the occasional cow-in-the-road experience.\nAlong the way, plan a stop at the Owyhee Canyon Overlook (22 miles from the highway turn-off) for breathtaking views of the Owyhee Wild and Scenic River far below.\nThe last two miles to the site drop quickly into the Three Forks canyon. It is best to stop at the canyon rim and assess the road conditions before attempting the descent with your vehicle, as it’s rocky, steep, and not regularly maintained. Visitors are encouraged to park their cars at the rim and hike down to the site, should driving conditions be too treacherous.\nOnce in the canyon, the recreation site features five designated campsites, a boat launch, vehicle parking, and vault restrooms.\nThe site is named Three Forks for the three sections of rivers – the Owyhee, the North Fork Owyhee, and the Middle Fork Owyhee – that converge in the area.\nPronghorn antelope can be found on the rangeland above the canyon, and the canyon interior is particularly important as mule deer winter range habitat. Elk also use this area in the winter and California Bighorn sheep are year-round residents within the Owyhee River corridor.\n\n\nPoint of Interest:\n\nRemnants of a historic military road can still be seen today, zig-zagging up the canyon’s west face, and old wagon and ranching roads near the recreation site allow for hiking and walking in the area.",

The loop is a 65-mile (105 km) system of unpaved roads which connects the small mountain towns of Lake City, Ouray, and Silverton. Most of the land in the area is managed by either the U.S. Forest Service or the Bureau of Land Management. The Alpine Loop is visited by over 100,000 people each year. Animas .Forks, at an elevation of 11,200 feet (3,400 m), is more than two miles (3 km) above sea level.\n\nThe unimproved road from Silverton to Animas Forks is passable in summer by two-wheel drive vehicles. The road beyond Animas Forks over Engineer Pass to Lake City may require four-wheel drive. The town's first log cabin was built in 1873 and by 1876 the community had become a bustling mining community. At that time the town contained 30 cabins, a hotel, a general store, a saloon, and a post office. By 1883 450 people lived in Animas Forks and in 1882 a newspaper, the Animas Forks Pioneer, began publication and lasted until October 1886. Every fall the residents of Animas Forks migrated en masse to the warmer town of Silverton. In 1884 a 23-day blizzard inundated the town with 25 feet (7.6 m) of snow, the residents had to dig tunnels to get from building to building. Mining, speculation and processing mills helped Animas Forks grow.When mining profits began to decline investment in Animas Forks was no longer justified. Although mining made a brief 1904 rebound with the construction of the Gold Prince Mill the town's mining days were nearing an end. A rail line ran through the area and stimulated interest in mining in the community again but the railroad never reached its expectations. The Gold Prince Mill closed in 1910 and in 1917 most of the mill's major parts were removed for a new facility in Eureka. The mill's dismantling signaled the beginning of the end for Animas Forks. The town was a ghost town by the 1920s.When mining profits began to decline investment in Animas Forks was no longer justified.

Mostly composed of granite uplifts from deep within the earth over 1 billion years ago, these granite monoliths were uplifted and carved by glaciers 500,000 years ago to form circular valley cirques. The Wind River Range is not only one of the oldest mountain ranges in North America, but has the most extensive glacial network in the lower 48 states. Elevations range from 8,000 feet at Green River Lakes to 13,804 feet at Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in the middle Rocky Mountains. The Green River Lakes are considered the headwaters of the Green River; the chief tributary to the Colorado River. The Green River runs 730 miles through Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, and eventually terminates in northern Mexico.They are also the starting point for many backpacking trails including the northern entrance to the frequently used Highline Trail, which extends along most of the Wind River Range and follows the spine of the Continental Divide south to Big Sandy Opening. Hiking the Highline Trail:Visitors have a view of the much-photographed large-granite monolith, Squaretop Mountain (11,695 feet) from the Green River Lakes. The mountain looms over pristine blue-green lakes. You can expect to view glimpses of large game animals such as moose, elk, deer, and pronghorn. Other remarkable and more common animals observed in the area include several hawks, both bald and brown eagles, fox, coyote, wolverines, yellow-bellied marmots (rock-chucks), and the golden-mantled squirrel. Occasionally a black bear or grizzly bear are spotted. The Wind River Range and the Upper Green River Valley were home to both Shoshone and Arapaho Native Americans, and provided sustenance and marketable goods for their daily livelihood as well as to early trappers and settlers. The road to Green River Lakes, which roughly parallels the river, passes the remains of the earliest dude ranch in Sublette County, the first in a long line of successful ranching businesses. For several weeks each June, the Green River Drift, one of the longest-running cattle drives in the nation takes place as wranglers push livestock from adjacent valleys to higher grounds with rich mountain pastures, a distance of about 70 miles. It is also a naturalist and angler’s paradise being home to the Mackinaw (lake trout), golden, brook, rainbow, brown, cutthroat, and grayling trout.  It can snow any day of the year in the Wind River Range. Visitors should come prepared for cold weather. Afternoon thunderstorms and rain showers are common in the summer and can build quickly.  Early in the season, hikers should be prepared to encounter high water crossings, muddy trail conditions, and tree downfall. Note that this is designated grizzly bear habitat and food storage regulations apply for both the campground and backcountry users. 29 East Fremont Lake Rd.P.O.

Emphasis in a wilderness area is on the primitive. Signing and trail marking will be minimal; developed campsites, footbridges, and garbage collection are non-existent. A wilderness is a special area set aside by Congress which “generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces of nature with the imprint of man’s work substantially unnoticeable…” Before you start, be prepared with adequate supplies; water sources with the wilderness are not recommended for drinking, and must be purified if used. Group size is limited to 10 persons.This 7035-acre wilderness is located in northwestern Texas County. In the early 1800’s Sylvester Paddy began the first logging of the area, transporting timber from this area by river to St. Louis. Until the 1930’s the area was homesteaded and grazed as open range. It became federally designated wilderness in 1983.Big Paddy and Little Paddy Creeks characterize the Paddy Creek Wilderness with steep cliffs and rock outcrops along the drainages. These creeks have water in them throughout most of the year. In the Wilderness are a few old fields in drainages but the rest is forested. Black, white, and post oaks, hickories and shortleaf pine are the main trees. Throughout the area, wildlife typical of the Missouri Ozarks is present. White-tailed deer, wild turkey, squirrel, rabbit, fox, coyote and bobcat are common.A printable brochure (pdf format) is available for download. Trail System Map (printable) and Trail System Map GEO Referenced for use with Map AppsTrails: There are 18 miles of designated trails within the wilderness. The elevation of the area changes 500 feet between a point near Roby Tower on the western edge of the area, and Paddy Creek as it meets the eastern boundary of the Wilderness. Signs and trail marking are minimal or non-existent and the use of maps and compass is recommended.   Travel is by foot or on horseback; No Motorized or Mechanized vehicles are permitted.",

Three of the summits that ring this dormant volcano's now quiet inner caldera are higher than any other mountain in the state.This mountain is sacred to the native peoples that live in the area and its soaring profile set against a blue Arizona sky serves as a source of awe to contemporary residents and visitors. Views from the summit of the San Francisco Peaks stretch to the Grand Canyon's North Rim over eighty miles away. Hiking, sightseeing, wildlife watching and skiing are the predominant recreation activities enjoyed in this land of mountains, forests and lava flows.Flagstaff Ranger District, extends from north of the Peaks to the south. This rolling highland is a land of ponderosa pine forests and pinyon/juniper woodlands clustered around broad prairies and small lakes. Arizona's largest natural lake, Mormon Lake, is located here. The area is also known for its plentiful wildlife. Large herds of elk roam the forests and edgelands. Bald eagles and ospreys live and hunt around the lakes. Pronghorn antelope graze the prairies.Principal recreation activities among the lakes and prairies are boating, fishing, camping, and wildlife watching. The area also boasts some excellent cross-country skiing in good snow years. See the Winter Recreation page for a recreation map, backcountry permit information, and more info! Flagstaff Winter Recreation Hotline1-844-256-SNOW (7669)Courtesy Flagstaff CVB --> Recreation Activities for the Flagstaff District:CampgroundsTrailsWilderness Areas, Boating/Fishing Sites, Scenic DrivesPicnic Areas, Archaeology Sites, Cabin Rentals and Winter ActivitiesMore InformationRoad StatusForest Orders",

    "description": "The colorful collection of buttes, pinnacles, mesas and canyons surrounding Sedona is famous the world around for its red rock vistas. Over the years, this area has served as the setting of many western novels and movies and has been the subject of uncounted paintings, photographs and other works of art. The remains of ancient wetlands, these crimson cliffs have been carved by the forces of the desert into one of nature's most magnificent masterpieces.No matter what you do in Red Rock Country, you're always sightseeing. Ways to get even closer to all this scenery include: hiking, horseback riding, taking a scenic drive, sliding down a natural waterslide, picnicking, camping, taking lots of photos and fishing in Oak Creek. The Red Rock District includes some 160,000 acres of magnificent splendor.  Some areas require a pass to park, so be sure to check out the information about our Red Rock Pass Program. Red Rock Recreation Guide [PDF]Get the scoop on the Red Rock Ranger District!Recreation Guide [PDF]Recreation MapsRed Rock Pass Information and find out where to get a Red Rock PassFee-free DaysRoad StatusForest Orders Red Rock Country Area MapRecreation activities for the Red Rock Ranger District shown in tables:CampgroundsTrails (A-J)Trails (K-Z)Wilderness Areas, Boating/Fishing Sites, Scenic DrivesPicnic Areas, Archaeology Sites, Cabin Rentals and Additional Information",

    "description": "NOTE!! The boat ramp at the reservoir is currently closed to trailers, as low water levels have exposed boulders and large rocks that make it unsafe and impossible for a trailer to be backed down the boat ramp. People may still access the water and carry kayaks and canoes to the water edge, but trailers with boats are not yet able to be backed down the boat ramp.This narrow, winding body of water looks more like a canyon-bound river than a lake. Be aware that this is a canyon lake--meaning there is very little shore access around the entire reservoir. The sides of the canyon that create this reservoir are steep and there are not any sandy shores like you might expect at a traditional lake with shoreline, which makes this reservoir a destination mainly for people kayaking, canoeing, and fishing.Fishers can catch rainbow, brown or brook trout here, stocked by the Arizona Game and Fish Department. Other types of recreation include sightseeing, wildlife watching, hiking, and mountain biking, but don't expect any wide open shores for sunbathing and swimming.C.C. Cragin Reservoir is an important water source for the town of Payson, Arizona. Forest thinning and prescribed burning in the area under the Cragin Watershed Protection Project is helping to protect this valuable water source and improve forest health in the area. C.C. Cragin Dam was built in 1965 by Phelps Dodge, and later transferred to the Salt River Project (SRP). Learn more about the reservoir's history on SRP's history of C.C.

    "description": "Situated in a beautiful canyon where water has carved the rock, Jack’s Canyon offers vertical to wildly overhanging routes on compact stone. The majority of the climbing is characterized by steep highly pocketed limestone/sandstone mix cliffs. Route length varies from short “bouldery” twenty foot routes to long “pumpy” routes around seventy feet. On vertical walls, the rock can be bubbly with edges and blocks. If you want to find fun and safe sport climbing on the Coconino National Forest, this is your place. Sport climbing, focused on movement and safety offers the opportunity for large dynamic moves on well protected routes. Fixed anchoring systems here keep climbers safe while minimizing impact to the rock compared to traditional anchoring systems such as pitons and trees. Jacks Canyon boasts 300 routes of what some consider being some of the best sport climbing in the country. Jacks Canyon is a great collaboration between the National Forest and the rapidly growing user group of rock climbers.The roll-over photos here are from the top of the rim overlooking climbing areas and at the bottom at the creek. Camping: The camping is free and unimproved at the canyon rim, where a 10 minute trail gets you to the routes. Please camp at obvious sites.Weather: The Weather is great year round with spring and fall offering the best conditions. In the summer you’ll be chasing the shade with temperatures rising to the 90’s F. During the winter, temperatures can get down to freezing and can be snowy, but the sun warms the rock. Chase the sun and you’ll be climbing in tee-shirt and shorts. Watch out for late spring and summer monsoon floods.Attractions: Climbing, Hiking, Wildlife viewingFacilities: Toilet (vault type), NO water or trash services (Pack-it-In, Pack-it-Out)",

Not too far away you'll find the Sandy's Canyon Trail which leads into an area of picturesque small canyons, big trees, and even bigger views.

    "description": "From the Abineau (#127) and Bear Jaw (#26) trails, on the north slope of the San Francisco Peaks, you can see the Grand Canyon seventy miles away. These two trails make a scenic loop through forested canyons. Both end at the Waterline Road (FR 146) along the base of a long talus slope topped by Humphreys Peak, Arizona's highest point. The climb along either two-mile trail is steep and steady through stands of mixed conifer and aspen. The road completes the loop by connecting the top of one trail to the other, ascending 600' over two miles from the top of Bear Jaw Trail to the top of Abineau Trail. From this high perspective the Grand Canyon cuts a wide gap in a the plateau stretching from the mountain to the horizon. With the almost half-mile connector trail from the trailhead to the loop (where Bear Jaw and Abineau split to follow different routes up the mountain), the entire hike is approximately 7 miles long.This route passes through an area colorful at all seasons of the year. In late spring, alpine wildflowers such as lupine, rocky mountain iris, penstemon and paintbrush splash the trailside meadows. Sunflowers add yellow in summer, and groves of aspen paint the slopes with crimson and gold during the fall.You may spot a black bear here—perhaps the best chance you'll have around the Peaks. These big shy animals occasionally show themselves along these trails. Mule deer and elk are also plentiful. Common birds include juncos, Steller's jays and Clark's nutcrackers. In spring and early summer the melodious hermit thrush will serenade you.Early in 2005, a huge avalanche did extensive damage to the trail in Abineau Canyon. Although the trail reopened by that summer, evidence of the avalanche still remains in toppled trees and gouged rock.  Photo tour of this hike on Flickr Download a slideshow about the Abineau-Bear Jaw Loop (PDF)",

    "description": "There are a number of reasons why West Fork is one of the most popular trails on the Coconino National Forest. Once you've strolled beside the pleasant little stream that ripples along the canyon floor and looked up, way up, at the dizzying cliffs that tower above it, you will fall in love with it, too. West Fork is fantastic throughout the year. In springtime, migrating songbirds decorate the trees with flashes of brilliance. In autumn, the canyon is ablaze with color, with red and gold leaves floating in clear reflecting pools under a canopy of solid color. In wintertime, icicles decorate from red rock overhangs, and snatches of snow persist in cool shadows. As a matter of fact, you'll probably find a new reason to be here every time you visit.As for the trail itself, it's an easy stroll, but you do have to cross the stream in a number of places. Usually, that involves negotiating a few strategically placed stepping stones or taking a couple of steps in shallow water. The trail is marked and maintained for the first three miles.Many hikers explore beyond the end of the maintained trail. Eventually the pathway ends, the route becomes more strenuous, and you will be forced to hike in the stream bed as you continue into the Red Rock-Secret Mountain Wilderness. If you choose to travel the entire 14 mile stretch from one end of the canyon to the other, plan to do a lot of wading and boulder hopping, and even some swimming. Please read this notice describing the strenuous 14 mile long full canyon route between SR 89A to FR 231 (Woody Mountain Road) before attempting this rugged wilderness route. No matter how long a hike you take here, you'll enjoy it best if you come at a time when the trail is least crowded. Mornings and weekdays are best, better yet if they're in the off-season.When you do come, remember to take special care and leave this beautiful place better than you found it. Of course you know not to litter, but picking flowers and autumn leaves can cause just as unsightly a scar. So can short-cutting or rock throwing. Treat this natural treasure with the care it deserves and you'll have plenty of reason to come back and see it again and again. .noprint { display: none; }Hover mouse over photo to display slideshow controls.

    "description": "Cove Boat Ramp offers access to Badin Lake for both motorized and non-motorized craft. A large parking area is available for vehicles and trailers.Fishing Badin Lake The biggest fishing hole in the Uwharrie National Forest is Badin Lake. This 5,350-acre impoundment of the Yadkin River was built in 1917 by the Aluminum Company of America (ALCOA) to generate hydroelectric power for the aluminum plant at Badin. The eastern shore borders the National Forest and the lake is well stocked with catfish, bream, largemouth, white and striped bass.The Forest Service has one launching site at the Cove Boat Ramp. The State has two ramps on the lake. Marinas offer easy access for everything from jon-boats to pontoons. The lake is crowded with pleasure boats on spring and summer weekends. Well attended bass tournaments are usually held every weekend from March through October.In early spring, fish are spawning and feeding well. Look for bluegill beds. These are circular depressions in the shallows. Catch them with crickets, worms or artificial bait. Fish along downed trees or stumps in the water for crappie and bass. Crappies will take minnows or jigs. For largemouth bass, you are going to have to work at it and try different lures. Look for largemouth around the rocky points.Small spinners are always good for feeding bluegill. Fly rod experts can put a hurting on a bream bed. Most white bass anglers use a black and chartreuse jig rigged about three feet under a weighted bobber. This set-up takes crappie too. White bass and crappie are caught by the score, especially in the spring.Carolina rigged plastic worms and lizards in assorted colors are local favorites for largemouth in the spring. Fishing live crawfish or minnows just off the bottom with a cork is an old fashioned, but effective, way to catch largemouth bass. An eight-pounder is a big'un at Badin but 3-to-4 pound fish are abundant.The State stocks about 25,000 striper fingerlings every year and Badin is known as a dependable put-and-take striper lake. Anglers can limit-out on 5 to 12 pound fish with a rare 20-pounder. Trolling live shad is the best way to catch stripers. Bottom fishing with chicken livers or cut-up shad will land catfish and stripers. A good rule is, \"bigger bait for bigger fish\".  Look for excited sea gulls working the water and you will likely find a school of frightened shad under attack by hungry stripers. Big, shiny top-water plugs are the way to go when that happens. Taking a striper on top water is probably the biggest thrill going on Badin Lake, unless it's winching up a 60-pound plus record catfish from the bottom.When the turbines are running in the Tuckertown dam, shad and other fish are sucked in, chewed up and spit out downstream where hungry stripers and catfish gorge themselves on easy pickings. Anglers brave the turbulent waters and clean up while fishing cut-bait during these tailrace feeding frenzies. Thirty and forty-pound catfish are caught regularly here. Anglers may have to share the airspace with the bald eagles that have discovered this fishy feast, as the eagles are coming back to the Uwharries.During the summer fish move to deeper water where it is cooler. The best times to fish are one hour before sunrise and one hour after sunset. Larger fish move deep because it's too hot for them in the shallows. That is when deep running crank baits work best for largemouth bass or aggressive stripers. Because fish are cold-blooded they move to deep, warm areas in the fall and will not bite as aggressively when the temperature cools down. Many largemouth bass and stripers are caught during those warm winter days that all Southern anglers appreciate.Anglers looking to beat the crowds can fish the Uwharrie River.",

This restriction is to reduce potential resource damage, minimize user conflicts, and provide a quieter, more family friendly experience for the more than 80,000 people hiking this trail each year. Visitors are encouraged to respect other users, this iconic landmark, and refraining from roped activities.

Later it became a way station on the Yellowstone Highway for ranchers, sportsmen, and tourists. After acquiring the inn from Montana Power in 1986, the Forest Service partnered with Harriman State Park and other generous groups to renovate the facilities and keep the site open. Big Falls Inn is now listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Exhibits on the natural and cultural history of the area can be enjoyed inside the visitor center.From the Visitor Center, an accessible trail and boardwalk provide spectacular views of Mesa Falls.  A rainbow often decorates the canyon on summer mornings when sunlight passes through the mist, and interpretive panels share the natural and cultural history of the area. As you take in the power and beauty of the falls, keep your eyes open for the osprey and eagles that frequent the area.Also in the area, the Mesa Falls Nature Trail meanders for about one mile through a quiet forest, ending at an overlook of the Lower Mesa Falls - an equally spectacular and powerful waterfall.",

The area is currently open to public use and entry, HOWEVER - The trails may not yet been assessed or maintained for hazards associated with the fire.  Please keep in mind that any area affected by the wildfire can be prone to hazards such as falling trees, flooding and burned out stump holes. The environment you are entering is highly susceptible to rainstorms and wind events. Any time you enter the forest, you should be aware of your environment and changing weather conditions. You are responsible for your own safety! Always look up, look down, and look all around.The Bear Wallow Wilderness is home to some of the largest acreage of virgin ponderosa pine in the Southwest, venerable reminders of a once extensive forest of these giants. Along the length of the area, through a blanket of pine, fir, and spruce, Bear Wallow Creek flows year-round and is shaded by green riparian hardwoods during summer. The creek provides a habitat for the endangered Apache trout; anglers can try for other species in the creek and its north and south forks. Early explorers were impressed by the large number of well-used wallows, which revealed how plentiful the area's population of black bears was. Black bears still abound, and you may see elk, deer, and a diverse community of smaller mammals, birds, and reptiles. Wildflowers bloom in profusion, especially during the summer rains. Poison ivy is present and can be dangerously abundant in places.Five trails offer foot and horse access to Bear Wallow. The Reno Trail #62 (1.9 miles) and the Gobbler Point Trail #59 (2.9 miles) drop into the canyon of the creek from easily accessible trailheads on Forest Service roads. The Bear Wallow Trail # 63 follows the rocky stream bed 8.2 miles to the boundary of the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. The Schell Canyon Trail #316 (2.8 miles) connects the Bear Wallow Trail and the canyon floor to the Rose Spring Trail #309 (4.5 miles), which skirts the southern boundary along the precipitous Mogollon Rim, the southern edge of the vast Colorado Plateau. From atop the Mogollon Rim the views to the south are tremendous. Visitors to the San Carlos Reservation must have an advance permit. For information and permits, contact the San Carlos Tribal Office, Box O, San Carlos, AZ 85550. Recreational use of Bear Wallow is light. Bear Wallow Wilderness is part of the 110 million acre National Wilderness Preservation System. This System of lands provides clean air, water, and habitat critical for rare and endangered plants and animals. In wilderness, you can enjoy challenging recreational activities like hiking, backpacking, climbing, kayaking, canoeing, rafting, horse packing, bird watching, stargazing, and extraordinary opportunities for solitude.You play an important role in helping to \"secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness\" as called for by the Congress of the United States through the Wilderness Act of 1964.Please follow the requirements outlined below and use Leave No Trace techniques when visiting the Bear Wallow Wilderness to ensure protection of this unique area.Leave No TracePlan Ahead and PrepareTravel and Camp on Durable SurfacesDispose of Waste ProperlyLeave What You FindMinimize Campfire ImpactsRespect WildlifeBe Considerate of Other VisitorsFor more information on Leave No Trace",

This is a lovely stream that is perfect for swimming in the early summer when the main Merced is too high. Springtime comes early around here (late February — April) and the wildflowers on the slopes of the North Fork Merced can be spectacular. There is a beautiful cascade about 3/4 of a mile upstream from the confluence that makes a great destination for a cool dip on a hot day.\n\nAlthough most people explore the North Fork as a day outing, it makes a great short or introductory backpacking adventure. The North Fork Merced is approximately a one-hour (2.5 mile) walk from the Railroad Flat campground along the old Yosemite Valley Railroad Grade (also known as the Merced River Trail). Access is by trail or river only. Bring plenty of water or, better yet, pack a water filter.\n\nPermits, Fees and Limitations:\n\nCampfire permits are required for all fires. Fire restrictions that prohibit all fires go into effect each summer (exact dates unknown). Please check for current conditions at: BLM California Fire Restrictions webpage.&nbsp; No overnight permit is required. Please follow Leave No Trace practices. Pack it in, pack it out.

Nestled in the heart of Gold Rush Country, the trail is lined with remnants from nearly 150 years ago when Chinese laborers channeled creek water by hand with pick and shovel for gold mining. Tailing piles from the Gold Rush period blanket the area which lend to the characteristic landscape that makes this area so unique.\n\nAs you travel along the Dave Moore Nature Trail you will encounter several natural features - most interesting is \"Mushroom Rock\" - two stacked granite boulders with a softer layer of decomposed granite in between that has been weathered by the river of the past.  Look for the tall Ponderosa pine trees too big in diameter to put your arms around.  And the majestic California Madrone tree in all it's awesome beauty is worth a stop to feel it's cooling smooth bark. Throughout the trail are hand made walls of lichen and moss covered rocks which guide your way to the South Fork American River -- your destination easily reached within a half mile from the parking lot trailhead.\n\nAfter you explore the cooling rivers edge, you can return along the trail the same way you came or choose to take the lower loop back up to the parking area.  Within the half mile loop back you travel thru shaded riparian habitat and oak woodland.  You will encounter large Incense cedar trees towering above you, gigantic granite boulders three times your height in amazing configurations and sizes, and beautiful native wildflowers, shrubs and trees of the local area.  Listen as birds call out to alert your presence on the trail.  Enjoy being surprised by the lizard in the grass scurrying across to greet you.  And see if you can find what little treasures have been left behind....\n\nPlease read about Hiking on Public Lands\n\n\n\n\nHistory\n\nDavid Moore was born June 4, 1949 in Memphis, Tennessee and died August 13, 2001 in Calistoga, California.  He graduated from Calistoga High School in 1967.  After graduation, he entered the Navy and served for a term of four years, then attended Humboldt State University where he graduated in 1975.  For the next ten years, Moore was employed by the Bureau of Land Management as a Conservation Ranger.  He was stricken with multiple sclerosis at age 35 and forced to retire in 1987.\n\nDavid Moore was an avid outdoorsman who loved to hunt, fish, whitewater raft, and golf.  His disability brought to his co-workers such an awareness of the challenge faced by disabled persons that they developed a Nature Area along the South Fork of the American River near Coloma, California.\n\nOn June 4, 1994, National Trails Day and Moore's 46 birthday, the staff of the BLM Folsom Resource Area (aka Mother Lode Field Office) held a grand opening of the Nature Area, and dedicated it as the Dave Moore Nature Area.\n\nA special thanks to Captain Frank Clark and his crew from the Growlsburg Conservation Camp and all the other individuals and groups who made this Nature Area possible.  We are sincerely grateful.\n\nAlso VISIT:  South Fork American River webpage\n\nOther BLM Trailheads:\n\n\n\tCronan Ranch Trailhead\n\tMagnolia Ranch Trailhead\n\n\nReturn To: BLM, Mother Lode Field Office",

    "description": "With its lush riparian ecosystem and dramatic topography of limestone cliffs and caves, this scenic area offers world-class climbing opportunities year-round. \nMotorized travel is restricted to designated roads and designated road areas within the BDWNCA  The popularity of rock climbing in southwest Utah is growing at a phenomenal pace. That popularity brings a corresponding increase in impacts to natural resources. The St. George Field Office requests that climbers practice “minimal impact” climbing and camping to protect fragile resources. \nWhen considering the development of new crags, please contact one of the BLM’s Outdoor Recreation Planners. They can alert you to potential issues like land ownership, sensitive species, and archaeological resources. Remember, your freedom to climb depends on you. \nThe minimal impact techniques listed below are advocated by the The Access Fund and have been adopted by the St. George Field Office as the standard for ethical climbing on public lands.   Archaeological Sites\n•\tDo not climb near any site that could be historic, archaeological or paleontological in nature. These sites are protected by law. \n•\tExamine, but do not disturb ancient or historic structures, archaeological artifacts, rock art, and fossils. These include, but are not limited to, Native American sacred sites, archaeological sites, petroglyphs and pictographs, ancient or historic carved steps or ladders, fossils and dinosaur tracks, ancient or historic trails, historic mining areas, structures and developed springs. \n•\tIf you witness vandalism of archaeological, historic or paleontological sites, please report it immediately by contacting the BLM St. George Field Office at (435) 688-3200.\nClimber Access Trails\n•\tTravel on durable surfaces such as rock, gravel and sand. \n•\tWhenever possible, use established trails. \n•\tLimit trail widening, vegetation trampling and social trail proliferation \n•\tAvoid trampling cryptobiotic crust. \n•\tAlways carry, never drag, your bouldering crashpad.\nDispose of Waste Properly\n•\tDo not urinate on vegetation or in rock cracks. Choose soil or sand. \n•\tIn heavily used areas, pack out all solid human waste, toilet paper and hygiene products in onetime-use waste bags. Burying human waste can result in unsightly and unsanitary conditions for other climbers. When packing it out is not an option, deposit solid human waste in a 6 - 8 inch deep hole at least 200 feet from water, trails, campsites, or the base of a crag.  Fixed Anchors\n•\tUse removable protection whenever possible \n•\tWhen fixed anchors are necessary, use matte colors that match the rocks.\nLitter\n•\tPack out all trash, and remove trash left by others\nNoise\n•\tAlthough vocal communication is part of the climber’s safety system, climbers should keep noise to a minimum whenever possible  Parking\n•\tStay on existing roads \n•\tDo not park off the roadway on vegetation \n•\tDo not block traffic\nPets\n•\tKeep pets on leashes or under physical control at all times \n•\tPrevent pets from harassing wildlife \n•\tControl barking \n•\tPack out pet waste.\nReducing Visual Impacts\n•\tDo not chip, chisel, glue, graffiti, or otherwise degrade or deface the rock \n•\tDo not start warming fires at the base of a climb; this defaces the rock and may cause wildfires \n•\tUse a chalk bag and keep it closed to you to prevent spills \n•\tIf possible, use a chalk color that is compatible with local rocks. \n•\tRemove chalk residue when rappelling or being lowered from top-roped routes",
